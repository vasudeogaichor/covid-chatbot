Questions,Answers
what is a coronavirus,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. For more information, please visit https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
how does covid spread,"People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. For more information, please visit https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
what can i do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease,"Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas. For more information, please visit https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
how likely am i to catch covid,"The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.
For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.
COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.
 For more information, please visit https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
should i worry about covid," Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.
We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings.

 For more information, please visit https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
who is at risk of developing severe illness,"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes)  appear to develop serious illness more often than others.  For more information, please visit https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the covid,"No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.  For more information, please visit https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure covid,"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available. For more information, please visit https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
is there a vaccin drug or treatment for covid,"Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.
Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19.
The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. (See Basic protective measures against the new coronavirus).
 For more information, please visit https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
is covid the same as sars,"No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different.
SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003 For more information, please visit https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
should i wear a mask to protect myself,"Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.
WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks  (see Advice on the use of masks).
The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new coronavirus for more information For more information, please visit https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
how to put on use take off and dispose of a mask,"Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers, and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.
Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water
Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.
Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).
Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).
Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.
Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.
After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.
Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.
Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water. For more information, please visit https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
how long is the incubation perod for covid,"The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available. For more information, please visit https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
can humans become infected with the covid from an animal source,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed.  
To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products. For more information, please visit https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
can i catch covid from my pet,"While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly. 
WHO continues to monitor the latest research on this and other COVID-19 topics and will update as new findings are available. For more information, please visit https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
how long does the virus survive on surfaces,"It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).
If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose. For more information, please visit https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
is it safe to receive a packae from any area where covid has been reported,"Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low.  For more information, please visit https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
is there anything i should not do,"The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:
Smoking
Wearing multiple masks
Taking antibiotics (See question 10 ""Are there any medicines of therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?"")
In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider. For more information, please visit https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
is the source of the coronavirus causing covid known,"Currently, the source of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus (CoV) causing COVID-19 is unknown. All available evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a natural animal origin and is not a constructed virus. SARS-CoV-2 virus most probably has its ecological reservoir in bats. SARS-CoV-2, belongs to a group of genetically related viruses, which also include SARS-CoV and a number of other CoVs isolated from bats populations. MERS-CoV also belongs to this group, but is less closely related. For more information, please visit https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
how did the first human sars cov infections occcur,"The first human cases of COVID-19 were identified in Wuhan City, China in December 2019. At this stage, it is not possible to determine precisely how humans in China were initially infected with SARS-CoV-2.
However, SARS-CoV, the virus which caused the SARS outbreak in 2003, jumped from an animal reservoir (civet cats, a farmed wild animal) to humans and then spread between humans. In a similar way, it is thought that SARS-CoV-2 jumped the species barrier and initially infected humans, but more likely through an intermediate host, that is another animal species more likely to be handled by humans - this could be a domestic animal, a wild animal, or a domesticated wild animal and, as of yet, has not been identified.
Until the source of this virus is identified and controlled, there is a risk of reintroduction of the virus in the human population and the risk of new outbreaks like the ones we are currently experiencing. For more information, please visit https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
is covid airborne,"The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. They quickly fall on floors or surfaces. 
You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within 1 metre of a person who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth before washing your hands. For more information, please visit https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
i got my flu shot this year can it help me warding off or dealing with covid,"The flu vaccine is a very good thing to get every year because it helps reduce the chances of getting the seasonal flu. However, the flu shot does not confer any protection against COVID-19. Despite similar symptoms, the flu shot will not prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19. For more information, please visit (courtesy of Dr. Adam Kassam, a Toronto-based physician who writes about health care and public: https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/columnists/kassam-your-covid-19-questions-answered-today-the-flu-shot/ policy): "
what s important to know is that getting a flu shot will have the indirect effect of helping with our health care system s covid response,"If we reduce the likelihood of seasonal flu and patients needing to be seen in clinics and hospitals, our health care workers will be able to focus their efforts on increasing capacity while treating the surge of COVID-19 patients they are seeing. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-basics"
is there a vaccine for coronavirus,"Developing new vaccines takes time and they must be rigorously tested and confirmed safe via clinical trials before they can be routinely used in humans. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US, has commonly stated a vaccine is at least a year to 18 months away. Experts agree there's a ways to go yet.   
However, there is great progress being made in this regard and a number of vaccine candidates have appeared in the time since COVID-19 was discovered. We've collated everything we know about potential vaccines and current treatment options that are being used around the world.
In developing a vaccine that targets SARS-CoV-2, scientists are looking at the spike proteins intensely. These proteins, which are present on the surface of the virus, enable it to enter human cells where it can replicate and make copies of itself. Researchers have been able to map the projections in 3D and research suggests they could be a viable antigen -- a fragment that stimulates the human body's immune system -- in any potential coronavirus vaccine. 
The protein is prevalent in coronaviruses we've battled in the past, too -- including the one that caused the SARS outbreak in China in 2002-2003. This has given researchers a head start on building vaccines against part of the spike protein and, using animal models, they have already demonstrated an immune response.
Notably, SARS, which infected around 8,000 people and killed around 800, seemed to run its course and then mostly disappear. It wasn't a vaccine that turned the tide on the disease but rather effective communication between nations and a range of tools that helped track the disease and its spread. 
""We learnt that epidemics can be controlled without drugs or vaccines, using enhanced surveillance, case isolation, contact tracking, PPE and infection control measures,"" MacIntyre said.

do people develop immunity,"Vaccines help a person to generate an immune response against an infection without first being exposed to the pathogen. Studies of other coronaviruses, such as the four that cause some common colds, lead most researchers to assume that people who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection will be protected from reinfection for a period of time. But that assumption needs to be backed by evidence, says Michael Diamond, a viral immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. “We don’t know that much about immunity to this virus.”A preprint1 posted online on 14 March by a team based in China looked at two rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) that had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, which caused them only mild illness. The monkeys did not seem to become re-infected when researchers exposed them to the virus for a second time four weeks after their initial exposure. Researchers will be looking for evidence that humans react in the same way, for instance by studying people potentially exposed multiple times, Diamond says. For more information, please visit https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00798-8"
if humans do develop immunity how long does it last,"That’s another big unknown. Immunity is short-lived for the coronaviruses that cause common colds; even people who have high levels of antibodies against these viruses can still become infected, says Stanley Perlman, a coronavirologist at the University of Iowa in Iowa City.

The evidence is more equivocal for the two other coronaviruses that have triggered epidemics: those that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Perlman says his team has found that after people recover from MERS, their antibodies against the virus drop precipitously. He also says that his team has gathered data — not yet published — showing that SARS antibodies are still present in the body 15 years after infection. But it’s not clear whether this immune response is enough to prevent reinfection. “We don’t have good evidence of long-lasting immunity, but we also don’t have really good data from both SARS and MERS,” Perlman adds. For more information, please visit https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00798-9"
what kind of immune response should vaccine developers look for,"The phase I trial that began this week focuses on the safety of a vaccine developed by Moderna, a company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. But researchers will also look closely at the nature of the immune response the vaccine summons.

The Moderna vaccine consists of an RNA molecule. Like many of the other SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development, it is designed to train the immune system to make antibodies that recognize and block the spike protein that the virus uses to enter human cells.

“I think it’s reasonable as a first pass, but we will learn that, perhaps, antibody responses to the spike exclusively may not be the whole story,” says Diamond. A successful SARS-CoV-2 vaccine might need to prompt the body to generate antibodies that block other viral proteins, for instance, or make T cells that can recognize and kill infected cells. For more information, please visit https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00798-10"
how do we know if a vaccine is likely to work,"Normally, vaccines go into human trials after tests for safety and effectiveness in animals. But the Moderna vaccine and another being developed by Inovio Pharmaceuticals in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, are being tested in animals at the same time as human phase I trials are happening. Inovio plans to begin its first human trial in April.

“In a non-emergency situation you might do this in a more serial way, but in this case a lot of things are being done in parallel,” says Barney Graham, deputy-director of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) Vaccine Research Center in Bethesda, Maryland, which is sponsoring the Moderna vaccine trial.

In a 2 March preprint2, researchers reported injecting Inovio’s vaccine — a DNA molecule carrying instructions to make the spike protein — into mice and guinea pigs. They found that the animals produced both antibodies and T cells against the virus. Study leader Kate Broderick, Inovio’s senior vice-president for preclinical research and development, says that her team has now given the vaccine to monkeys and is soon to start studies in which vaccinated animals are infected with the virus to see whether they are protected. Such ‘challenge’ studies are also in the works for the Moderna vaccine, says Graham.

He adds that large, costly trials of whether a vaccine can prevent infections in people won’t proceed without such data from animals. Diamond expects that as researchers learn more about the infection from both human and animal studies, they will get a better sense of which vaccines are likely to work best. “It may not be the most efficient way to do it. But it may be the most expedient way to generate a vaccine,” says Diamond. For more information, please visit https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00798-11"
will it be safe,"Because they are given to large numbers of healthy people, vaccines usually have a higher bar for safety than do drugs administered to people who are already ill. With SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, researchers’ main safety concern is to avoid a phenomenon called disease enhancement, in which vaccinated people who do get infected develop a more severe form of the disease than people who have never been vaccinated. In studies of an experimental SARS vaccine reported3 in 2004, vaccinated ferrets developed damaging inflammation in their livers after being infected with the virus.

Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, thinks potential vaccines should be tested in animals first to rule out disease enhancement, before trials move on to humans. He says he understands the reasoning for pushing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to human tests quickly, but adds that, because of the possibility that a vaccine could enhance disease, “I’m not sure this is the vaccine you want to do it for”.

In testing the Moderna vaccine, Graham says, the NIH will move to larger human studies only once human and animal studies confirm that the vaccine is safe. He says the risk of enhancement is low, but “the risk of not getting vaccines advanced quickly — so that we can have something available for the next winter season to at least test in the field — that risk is fairly high”.

can employees be restricted from traveling to impacted countries,"At this point, there have been numerous countries around the world impacted by the coronavirus. While employers can limit business travel or cancel company events, employees who plan to travel for personal reasons cannot be restricted from doing so. That said, as an employer, you may ask employees to notify you prior to any overseas travel. Furthermore, you may be able to take additional steps to ensure the safety of everyone who is employed at your facility, such as implementing a work-from-home policy or other limited staffing plan. For more information, please visit https://hrexecutive.com/answering-your-legal-questions-about-coronavirus/"
can i legally restrict visitors to the workplace amid coronavirus concerns,"While you likely have the right to insist that anyone who has a fever or flu symptoms not visit your work facilities, it is advisable to ensure that any such policy is applied uniformly across all demographic groups. This includes contractors, vendors and visitors. A posted policy should be visible to anyone entering your facility. You may wish to consider a hand-held temperature-screening device, provided the use of such a device is legal in your state. A local lawyer can help you determine what is legal and appropriate in your specific situation. For more information, please visit https://hrexecutive.com/answering-your-legal-questions-about-coronavirus/"
does fmla apply to employees who need to take off due to coronavirus illness,"If the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) guidelines apply to your business, employees may have leave benefits available to them. The reason the coronavirus likely qualifies is that it is classified as a “serious health condition.” Keep in mind, this may also apply if the employee requires time off to care for an immediate family member.

It is important to note that there may also be state laws that apply, especially for those companies that aren’t subject to FMLA. A local attorney can explain which laws apply to your business. For more information, please visit https://hrexecutive.com/answering-your-legal-questions-about-coronavirus/"
would my company be liable if an employee contracts coronavirus at work,"Employees who contract coronavirus on the job, particularly healthcare workers, may be entitled to collect workers’ compensation. Because of this, employers may be responsible for covering medical bills associated with the disease if an employee becomes ill due to contact with someone in the workplace. You may need to ensure you have spoken with a medical professional to assist you in determining if there is a relationship between the job and the employee being stricken with the virus.Employees may also be entitled to disability payments if such benefits are part of your overall benefits plan. Make sure you have verified any limits on coverage and plan for any resources you may need to administer the program. Your insurance-plan provider may have additional guidance.

Lastly, employers should always seek to reduce potential tort claims by following commercially reasonable practices. For example, if a particular geographic area or industry is affected disproportionately by illness, employers may collectively take extraordinary measures. It’s probably not a good idea to be the outlier in that case. For more information, please visit https://hrexecutive.com/answering-your-legal-questions-about-coronavirus/"
do i need to pay an employee who misses work due to being quarantined,"Whether an employee must be paid during quarantine will depend, in large part, on the benefits that you offer in relation to sick leave and applicable law (like FMLA). If you have workers who are exempt and they show up for work during any given week and you send them home, you may still be required to pay them for the entire work week. Employees who have a specific number of sick days and/or personal days may also elect to use those benefits during a period they are quarantined.

This is a good time to review your current benefits offering and see how many employees have accumulated paid sick and personal leave time. Having this information can be helpful to ensure your business is not negatively impacted in the event numerous employees opt to take time off during a potential outbreak or threat to their health in the workplace.

It is also important to note that your state may have its own “sick leave” law that applies. An employment lawyer can help you determine if your policy meets the legal standards in your state. For more information, please visit https://hrexecutive.com/answering-your-legal-questions-about-coronavirus/"
how can i communicate my global health emergency policy as an employer,"Your company emergency policies should be clearly spelled out in your Employee Handbook. This can help ensure that employees at all levels understand what steps you believe will keep your workplace safe for everyone.

While your HR policies should ideally always be up-to-date, this is a great time to review all of the HR documents your company uses. It is always a good idea to work with a lawyer when drafting or revising human resources policy.

Ensuring that employees practice regular hand washing and that your facilities are properly cleaned may also help curb potential spreading of the virus. In order to help your team feel safe, keep hand sanitizer and disinfectant on hand, and ensure that your restrooms are stocked with the appropriate soap, towels and toiletries. Additional guidance for businesses and employers can be found through the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention.

are there any tests that i can purchase to test myself at home for covid,"At this time, the FDA has not authorized any test that is available to purchase for testing yourself at home for COVID-19. The FDA sees the public health value in expanding the availability of COVID-19 testing through safe and accurate tests that may include home collection, and we are actively working with test developers in this space. In the other FAQs on this page you can find listings of tests that have received an EUA authorization as well as labs and manufacturers that have notified FDA as set forth in the FDA's Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019. For more information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/faqs-diagnostic-testing-sars-cov-2"
what tests for covid have received emergency use authorization,"All in vitro diagnostic tests that have received an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) are listed on the EUA page. For more information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/faqs-diagnostic-testing-sars-cov-3"
what laboratories are offering testing under the policy outlined in section iv a of the policy for diagnostic tests for coronavirus disease,"As stated in Section IV.A of the FDA's Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019, for laboratories certified under CLIA to perform high-complexity testing, the FDA does not intend to object to the use of validated tests for specimen testing for a reasonable period of time after validation while the laboratory is preparing an EUA request. As noted in the guidance, FDA believes 15 business days is a reasonable period of time to prepare an EUA submission for a test that has already been validated.

Many commercial and healthcare system/academic laboratories have notified the FDA that they have validated their own COVID-19 test and have started patient testing as set forth in Section IV.A of the FDA's Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019. The laboratories listed below have agreed to be identified on the FDA's website. The FDA has not yet reviewed the laboratory's validation of tests offered under this policy or issued EUAs for these laboratories' tests and is including this list here to provide transparency regarding the notifications submitted to FDA.

what commercial manufacturers are distributing test kits under the policy outlined in section iv c of the policy for diagnostic tests for coronavirus disease,"As stated in Section IV.C of the FDA's Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019, the FDA does not intend to object to a commercial manufacturer's development and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 test kits for specimen testing for a reasonable period of time after the manufacturer's validation of the test and while the manufacturer is preparing its EUA request where the manufacturer provides instructions for use of the test and posts data about the test's performance characteristics on the manufacturer's website. Transparency can help mitigate potential adverse impacts from a poorly designed test by facilitating better informed decisions by potential purchasers and users. As noted in the guidance, FDA believes that 15 business days is a reasonable period of time to prepare an EUA submission for a test whose performance characteristics have already been validated. This policy does not apply to at home testing.

The commercial manufacturers listed below have notified FDA that they have validated and are distributing test kits as set forth in Section IV.C of the FDA's Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019. The FDA has not yet reviewed the validation of the tests of these manufacturers or issued EUAs for these manufacturers' tests and is including this list here to provide transparency regarding the notifications submitted to FDA.

what serology tests are being offered under the policy outlined in section iv d of the policy for diagnostic tests for coronavirus disease,"As stated in Section IV.D of the FDA's Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019, the FDA does not intend to object to the development and distribution by commercial manufacturers, or development and use by laboratories, of serology tests to identify antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, where the test has been validated, notification is provided to FDA, and information along the lines of the following is included in the test reports:

This test has not been reviewed by the FDA.
Negative results do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in those who have been in contact with the virus. Follow-up testing with a molecular diagnostic should be considered to rule out infection in these individuals.
Results from antibody testing should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection or to inform infection status.
Positive results may be due to past or present infection with non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains, such as coronavirus HKU1, NL63, OC43, or 229E.
This policy does not apply to at home testing.

The commercial manufacturers and laboratories listed below have notified FDA that they have validated and are offering serology tests as set forth in Section IV.D of the FDA's Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019. The FDA has not reviewed the validation of tests offered by these developers, who will not be pursuing EUAs, and is including this list here to provide transparency regarding the notifications submitted to FDA.

when fda authorizes under an eua a sars cov test for use at the point of care does that mean it is clia waived,"Yes.  The settings in which an EUA-authorized test may be used are described in the Letter of Authorization.  As discussed in the Guidance for Industry and Other Stakeholders: Emergency Use Authorization of Medical Products and Related Authorities, when the FDA authorizes point of care tests (including SARS-CoV-2 point of care test systems) under an EUA, such tests are deemed to be CLIA waived tests.  Accordingly, for the duration of the emergency declaration, such tests can be performed in a patient care setting that is qualified to have the test performed there as a result of operating under a CLIA Certificate of Waiver or Certificate of Compliance.

We note that the term point of care in the EUAs may include settings such as hospitals, physician offices, urgent care, outreach clinics, and temporary patient care settings that have appropriately trained personnel to perform the test and are operating under a CLIA Certificate of Waiver or Certificate of Compliance. These terms generally do not apply to home specimen collection or at home testing unless otherwise specified.  For more information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/faqs-diagnostic-testing-sars-cov-8"
when tests are offered prior to or without an eua under the fda s policy for diagnostic tests for coronavirus disease what is their clia categorization,"Tests being offered prior to or without an EUA under the policies outlined in the FDA's Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019 that have not yet been reviewed by the FDA, are not FDA authorized, and have not received a CLIA categorization.  While FDA has indicated that such tests may be appropriate for use in clinical laboratories and by healthcare workers at the point of care, the policies in the Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019 do not provide a CLIA categorization and do not override any CLIA requirements.  Therefore, in accordance with CLIA, tests offered under these policies are considered high complexity by default until or unless they are authorized and deemed to be appropriate, through an EUA authorization or general FDA review processes, to be performed as moderate or waived complexity tests.
 
Laboratories using tests being marketed under the FDA’s EUA policy should be mindful of CLIA requirements which are enforced by CMS and certain State authorities, and CMS guidance for laboratories during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Under CMS guidance, if a facility has the appropriate CLIA certificates and follows applicable CLIA regulations, state regulations and guidelines, the laboratory’s CLIA certificate can be extended to cover testing in areas outside of the designated primary site or home base such as contiguous buildings, or any other designated temporary overflow location in its facility or temporary remote location, such as a parking lot.

i requested and received an eua template prior to the policy for diagnostic tests for coronavirus disease which was accompanied by a posting on the web of the eua template for clinical laboratories the first version references testing clinical specimens and the new version references testing clinical specimens which is accurate,"Due to the limited availability of reagents for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and the growing need for testing suspected cases of the COVID-19, the FDA revised the EUA templates for both clinical laboratories and manufacturers with regard to EUA submissions for tests intended for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. As set forth in the guidance, the FDA recommends clinical evaluation should include 30 contrived clinical specimens. For more information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/faqs-diagnostic-testing-sars-cov-10"
can i offer my test for home use and or self collection under the policy for diagnostic tests for coronavirus disease,"As noted in the guidance, the policies outlined in the Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019 do not apply to at-home testing, including self-collection of samples to be sent to a clinical laboratory.

FDA encourages developers to discuss their validation of home use and/or self-collection tests with us early in their development process. For more information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/faqs-diagnostic-testing-sars-cov-11"
are two or more viral targets needed to validate an rt pcr sars cov assay,"Based on evidence that has become recently available, and with the increased spread of COVID-19, FDA believes an appropriately validated single viral target SARS-CoV-2 assay could provide acceptable performance. Please refer to the policy outlined in Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019, which includes recommendations regarding the minimum testing to be performed to ensure analytical and clinical validity for COVID-19 diagnostic assays, as well as the templates for EUA submissions provided on FDA's website.

i am developing a covid assay that is a modification of a previously eua authorized covid assay do i need to start from scratch with my validation or can i validate my test with a bridging study,"As discussed in the Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019, FDA does not intend to object to the use of a test, without a new or amended EUA, where the test is validated using a bridging study to an EUA-authorized test. One way to bridge to a new component is to establish equivalent performance between parallel testing of the same specimens with the new and original components. We recommend testing 3-fold serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 viral materials (e.g., whole genomic viral RNA or inactivated virus, etc.) in pooled respiratory sample matrix in triplicate.

As noted in the guidance, in these cases, while FDA does not intend to object where no EUA request is submitted, FDA would like to see your validation data informally through an email to CDRH-EUA-Templates@FDA.HHS.GOV. If FDA's review of validation data indicates that it could be applicable to modifications of other tests with an authorized EUA, and the laboratory agrees to FDA sharing that information on our website for use by other laboratories, FDA intends to update our FAQs so other laboratories can refer to the validation for their testing, without conducting their own bridging study for the same modification.

The CDC has granted a right of reference to the performance data contained in the CDC's EUA request (FDA submission number EUA200001) to any entity seeking an FDA EUA for a COVID-19 diagnostic device. Laboratories bridging to another EUA-authorized assay must obtain a right of reference to leverage the performance data for that EUA-authorized assay. For more information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/faqs-diagnostic-testing-sars-cov-13"
what are the current recommendations regarding minimum testing for demonstrating performance of a new covid assay,"Please refer to Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019, where we have provided recommendations regarding the minimum testing to be performed to ensure analytical and clinical validity of these tests.

i am having trouble obtaining viral transport media universal transport media vtm utm and a flocked nasopharyngeal swab to collect and transport patient samples are there alternatives that i can use,"The alternative recommendations below are made in the context of limited quantities of testing supplies during this public health crisis, based on the best available evidence and in consultation with outside experts. We have included a list of examples of products, including catalog numbers for different distributors. The absence of a specific product from this list does not imply unacceptability of that product if it is of the correct type. Other companies may write to FDA at CDRH-EUA-Templates@FDA.HHS.GOV to request their products be included here.

The information provided is not an endorsement of any one product over another of the same type. We note that the information below is not intended to alter any already issued EUA for a COVID-19 diagnostic test nor is it intended to speak to any specific FDA regulatory requirement. Rather, as stated above, the information is being provided to help address availability concerns regarding certain critical components of COVID-19 diagnostic tests during this pandemic.

If you have validated additional alternatives, FDA would like to see your validation data informally through an email to CDRH-EUA-Templates@FDA.HHS.GOV.

The FDA encourages such laboratories developing tests to consider the validation recommendations in the guidance as they seek to validate their tests. If you pursue an alternate approach, we recommend discussing plans with us early, through the pre-EUA program. Please contact us at CDRH-EUA-Templates@fda.hhs.gov.

As noted in the guidance, once your test is validated and you are ready to begin clinical testing, labs should notify the FDA at CDRH-EUA-Templates@fda.hhs.gov and provide the name of the lab, lab director, address, and contact person. In the guidance, we recommend that you confirm the first five positive and the first five negative samples with an EUA-authorized test and include in your test report a statement that the FDA review of the validation is pending.

As stated in the guidance, the FDA does not intend to object to the use of validated tests for specimen testing for a reasonable period of time after validation while the laboratory is preparing an EUA request. The FDA believes 15 business days is a reasonable period of time to prepare an EUA submission for a test that has already been validated.

We strongly encourage laboratories testing under this policy to contact their state public health department as early as possible in the process (perhaps even before receipt of any orders or samples) to help ensure they have capacity for the validation testing described in the guidance and have the information necessary to support case investigations. We also encourage laboratories to be sure they are familiar with state and local laws mandating reporting of diseases and conditions of public health significance.

do i need a test,"It depends.

Despite President Trump saying last week that ""anyone who wants a test can get a test,"" officials say that getting everyone tested is a long-term goal. Currently, testing is limited and should be for those who really need it, public health officials told ABC News.

As of March 13, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) labs have tested some 3,900 specimens of the virus, while U.S. public health labs have tested over 12,000 specimens. More than 81 public health labs are online in all 50 states and are conducting testing, according to the CDC, with testing results still pending. For more information, please visit https://abcnews.go.com/US/coronavirus-testing-including-drive-clinics-covid-19-spreads/story?id=69584513"
why test,"Many COVID-19 symptoms are similar to the common cold and influenza, but only testing can confirm an infection. This is different, for instance, from China, which for a period of time included clinical diagnoses in its count in addition to lab-confirmed tests. Scientists told ABC News that changing that methodology could complicate tracking the disease.Public health officials told ABC News that testing is necessary mainly to track the spread of disease and ensure proper treatment and isolation for those infected, especially since COVID-19 is an influenza-like illness. For more information, please visit https://abcnews.go.com/US/coronavirus-testing-including-drive-clinics-covid-19-spreads/story?id=69584514"
how does it work,"On Friday, the White House announced a new testing protocol where prospective patients are directed to a screening website. If they have symptoms, they will be directed to a drive-thru testing site, like those in Denver and elsewhere. Those tests will be sent to labs for analysis, said Dr. Debbie Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator.

But public health officials told ABC News that it is not like taking a pregnancy test or other common medical tests. Instead, it is more like the test for Ebola, they said, providing a set of data as opposed to a yes or no answer.

Under the current protocol, according to officials, test administered by hospitals or clinics typically involve:

-Two sets of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

-20 to 25 minutes to put on and take off PPE.

-Transporting the sample to the lab -- a process called real-time PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)

-A certified epidemiologist confirms every positive test.

-Results are entered into the system.

Any test conducted on someone under quarantine requires even more resources and protection, the officials told ABC News.

Under the new protocol, using the drive-thru sites, ""the goal is for individuals to be able to drive up and be swabbed without having to leave your car,"" President Trump said on March 13. The test uses a nasal swab, Birx said. For more information, please visit https://abcnews.go.com/US/coronavirus-testing-including-drive-clinics-covid-19-spreads/story?id=69584515"
how long will the results take,"It depends. Results had been taking a few days, but the new testing procedure would take 24 hours from start to finish, Birx said. For more information, please visit https://abcnews.go.com/US/coronavirus-testing-including-drive-clinics-covid-19-spreads/story?id=69584516"
can i test negative and later test positive,"According to the CDC, yes.

Under the CDC-developed test, a negative result means the virus was not detected in the patient's sample, which is possible in the early stages of infection.

""For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness,"" the CDC said. For more information, please visit https://abcnews.go.com/US/coronavirus-testing-including-drive-clinics-covid-19-spreads/story?id=69584517"
what if i test positive,"As ABC News' chief medical correspondent Dr. Jen Ashton and other medical experts have pointed out, there is no treatment for this virus.

MORE: CDC moves to rapidly expand COVID-19 testing capabilities in US
All medical professionals can do for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is keep their body healthy to allow it to fight off the virus. Ventilators are used to assist in breathing in some cases and antibiotics are used to fight off secondary infections a patient may develop.

Experts also say it will take a year to 18 months to develop a vaccine because testing it in real-world environments and ensuring it works is time-consuming. For more information, please visit https://abcnews.go.com/US/coronavirus-testing-including-drive-clinics-covid-19-spreads/story?id=69584518"
what are the new tests coming,"Three labs, Everlywell, MicroGenDX and Nurx -- have made it possible to test for COVID-19 right from your living room.

Home kits allow patients to swab at home, send samples to a central lab and have results within days. However, swabs are in short supply, so many of these companies are expecting supply chain problems and are actively looking for workarounds.

All the at-home testing kits have to get shipped to a lab for results. The Everlywell and Nurx tests get results between 48 hours or ""within days"" while MicroGenDX's COVID-19 Rapid PCR Test has a 24-hour turnaround from time of receipt.

MicroGenDX will have the capacity to process over 8,000 samples per day beginning April 1 or sooner.

Traditional testing labs such as Hologic, LabCorp and Abbott -- are working to speed up their existing testing capacity.

Hologic has FDA approval to provide results for coronavirus tests in less than three hours and to process up to 1,150 tests in a 24-hour period.

LabCorp expects to perform 10,000 tests every day and by the end of the month conduct 20,000 per day.

Abbott is scaling up production at its U.S. manufacturing location to reach up to one million tests per week by end of March. Their m2000 RealTime testing system is currently available in hospitals and molecular laboratories and ships 150,000 laboratory tests immediately.

can covid be spread through bodily fluids such as blood sweat or semen,"Current evidence suggests that there is no risk of contracting COVID-19 from bodily fluids (blood, sweat, semen). The virus is spread by respiratory droplets when a person who is infected coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 is most commonly spread by:

close contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze;
touching infected surfaces with your hands and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes. For more information, please visit https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/answers-questions-coronavirus-covid19/#c46774"
can covid be spread by contact with the faces of a person who is sick,"The risk of contracting COVID-19 by contact with an infected person’s feces is low, but possible. This is why you must wash your hands regularly, especially after going to the bathroom and before eating. For more information, please visit https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/answers-questions-coronavirus-covid19/#c46775"
can a person who does not have symptoms spread covid,"The risk of getting COVID-19 if you have contact with someone who does not have any symptoms is low.

However, many people who are infected have only mild symptoms. This is especially true in the early stages of the disease. For example, you can get COVID-19 if you have contact with someone who has only a mild cough but does not feel sick.

That’s why you are advised to keep at least 2 metres away from other people even if no one has symptoms. For more information, please visit https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/answers-questions-coronavirus-covid19/#c46776"
could the arrival of spring and the warmer weather affect the spread of covid,"It might, but so far COVID-19 has been found in many countries, whatever their climate. At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when the weather becomes warmer. For more information, please visit https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/answers-questions-coronavirus-covid19/#c46777"
what is physical distancing is it really effective is slowing the spread of covid,"Physical distancing means keeping a certain distance from other people. Since COVID-19 is mainly spread by close contact with infected people, it is one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of the disease. To minimize close contact with other people who are infected, you must:

Stay at home as much as possible;
Avoid non-essential gatherings with people who do not live in your household (for example, dinner with friends);
Avoid physical contact with people who are most at risk of complications (older adults, people with chronic diseases or a weakened immune system);
If you must go out, stay at least 2 metres (around 6 feet) away from other people as much as possible. For more information, please visit https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/answers-questions-coronavirus-covid19/#c46778"
when should i wash my hands,"As often as possible, but especially:

Before touching your face (eyes, mouth, nose);
After coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose;
After going to the bathroom;
When your hands are visibly dirty or after touching something dirty;
Before and after providing care to a family member or friend;
Before and after preparing meals;
Before and after eating;
Before and after going to a public place (for example, the grocery store or pharmacy). For more information, please visit https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/answers-questions-coronavirus-covid19/#c46779"
is wearing a mask protect me effectively against covid,"Masks are not the best protective measure against infections such as COVID-19 for the general population in Québec. Their use is recommended for patients with a suspected infection. In this situation, when it is necessary to wear a mask, a procedure mask is used. It must be worn solely in the presence of other people or in a health-care setting. The mask enables infected individuals to protect the people around them by retaining potentially contaminated fine droplets that are discharged when they breathe or sneeze.

Because of the nature of their work, health professionals use the N95 mask, which protects them from viruses by filtering the air that they breathe. For more information, please visit https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/answers-questions-coronavirus-covid19/#c46780"
can i replace antiseptic gel with other products found in the home,"Washing your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds is the best method. Antiseptic gel should be used when soap and water are unavailable. Acetone-based products such as nail polish remover or hydrogen peroxide, mainly sold in drugstores, are not designed to disinfect the hands and pose a health hazard For more information, please visit https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/answers-questions-coronavirus-covid19/#c46781"
should i wear gloves to protect myself,"There is a shortage of medical gloves right now. They should be reserved for use by health professionals. Wearing gloves can give you a false sense of security. The best way to protect yourself is to wash your hands frequently and properly. Go to the page Washing your hands to find out how. For more information, please visit https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/answers-questions-coronavirus-covid19/#c46782"
would it be a good idea to catch the virus so that i would be immunized afterwards i e to develop resistance to the virus,"No, it would be risky and the benefits are uncertain. There is a real risk, even for young people, of catching COVID-19 and being hospitalized or admitted to intensive care.

In addition, even if infected people develop antibodies against the virus, at this time it is impossible to know if this would provide a natural defence or effective, lasting immunity. For more information, please visit https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/answers-questions-coronavirus-covid19/#c46783"
are screening tests effective if you don t have symptoms,"At this time, it cannot be confirmed that tests done on people who are asymptomatic are conclusive, However, if a person has symptoms consistent with COVID‑19 and had close contact with a confirmed case, they can be considered to have COVID‑19 without doing a test. For more information, please visit https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/answers-questions-coronavirus-covid19/#c46784"
why isn t everyone being tested,"The coronavirus disease (COVID‑19) pandemic is evolving very rapidly. Whereas in January and February, COVID‑19 was spread by returning travellers, most cases are now caused by community transmission.

This means that testing priorities need to be revised. From now on, testing will focus on people who are most at risk of being hospitalized or developing complications due to the infection and on people who play a critical role in the fight against the infection in Québec.

This prioritization of testing will help maintain health services, first responder services and essential services by identifying symptomatic people who might be involved in outbreaks in their workplace and among people who are at risk.

what is convalescent plasma how could it help people with covid,"When people recover from COVID-19, their blood contains antibodies that their bodies produced to fight the coronavirus and help them get well. Antibodies are found in plasma, a component of blood.

Convalescent plasma — literally plasma from recovered patients — has been used for more than 100 years to treat a variety of illnesses from measles to polio, chickenpox, and SARS. In the current situation, antibody-containing plasma from a recovered patient is given by transfusion to a patient who is suffering from COVID-19. The donor antibodies help the patient fight the illness, possibly shortening the length or reducing the severity of the disease.

Though convalescent plasma has been used for many years, and with varying success, not much is known about how effective it is for treating COVID-19. There have been reports of success from China, but no randomized, controlled studies (the gold standard for research studies) have been done. Experts also don't yet know the best time during the course of the illness to give plasma.

On March 24th, the FDA began allowing convalescent plasma to be used in patients with serious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19 infections. This treatment is still considered experimental.

who can donate plasma for covid,"In order to donate plasma, a person must meet several criteria. They have to have tested positive for COVID-19, recovered, have no symptoms for 14 days, currently test negative for COVID-19, and have high enough antibody levels in their plasma. A donor and patient must also have compatible blood types. Once plasma is donated, it is screened for other infectious diseases, such as HIV.

Each donor produces enough plasma to treat one to three patients. Donating plasma should not weaken the donor's immune system nor make the donor more susceptible to getting reinfected with the virus.

is the antiviral drug remdesivir effective for treating covid,"Scientists all over the world are testing whether drugs previously developed to treat other viral infections might also be effective against the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

One drug that has received a lot of attention is the antiviral drug remdesivir. That's because the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is similar to the coronaviruses that caused the diseases SARS and MERS — and evidence from laboratory and animal studies suggests that remdesivir may help limit the reproduction and spread of these viruses in the body. In particular, there is a critical part of all three viruses that can be targeted by drugs. That critical part, which makes an important enzyme that the virus needs to reproduce, is virtually identical in all three coronaviruses; drugs like remdesivir that successfully hit that target in the viruses that cause SARS and MERS are likely to work against the COVID-19 virus.

Remdesivir was developed to treat several other severe viral diseases, including the disease caused by Ebola virus (not a coronavirus). It works by inhibiting the ability of the coronavirus to reproduce and make copies of itself: if it can't reproduce, it can't make copies that spread and infect other cells and other parts of the body.

Remdesivir inhibited the ability of the coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS to infect cells in a laboratory dish. The drug also was effective in treating these coronaviruses in animals: there was a reduction in the amount of virus in the body, and also an improvement in lung disease caused by the virus.

The drug appears to be effective in the laboratory dish, in protecting cells against infection by the COVID virus (as is true of the SARS and MERS coronaviruses), but more studies are underway to confirm that this is true.

Remdesivir was used in the first case of COVID-19 that occurred in Washington state, in January 2020. The patient was severely ill, but survived. Of course, experience in one patient does not prove the drug is effective.

Two large randomized clinical trials are underway in China. The two trials will enroll over 700 patients, and are likely to definitively answer the question of whether the drug is effective in treating COVID-19. The results of those studies are expected in April or May 2020. Studies also are underway in the United States, including at several Harvard-affiliated hospitals. It is hard to predict when the drug could be approved for use and produced in large amounts, assuming the clinical trials indicate that it is effective and safe.

i have symptoms of coronavirus disease covid or i have covid what can i do to take care of myself,"If you have symptoms of coronavirus disease, you will feel tired and weak. Rest will help you fight the disease. Limit your contact with other people until the symptoms have resolved. You can resume your activities when your condition allows.

It is important to drink often because fever makes you sweat and lose a lot of fluids. At least 1.5 litres of fluids per day is recommended. Have hot or cold or drinks, whichever you prefer. Avoid alcoholic beverages or beverages that contain caffeine, such as coffee, tea and soft drinks. Alcohol and caffeine will make you urinate and increase fluid loss (dehydration).

Watch for the following signs of dehydration:

sensation of extreme thirst;
dry mouth and tongue;
infrequent or dark urine;
dizziness, confusion and headaches.
Complications of COVID-19 can develop a few days after symptoms first appear. If symptoms become more acute, you must go to the emergency room immediately or, if you need help, call 911. Watch for the following signs of a deterioration:

body temperature over 38°C (100.4°F);
persistent or increasing difficulty breathing;
drowsiness, confusion, disorientation or difficulty staying awake;
no urine for 12 hours;
fever in a baby under 3 months of age. For more information, please visit https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/answers-questions-coronavirus-covid19/#c46786"
how should i clean my environment,"The virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can live on objects and surfaces. It can survive for:

3 hours on objects with dry surfaces;
6 days on objects with wet surfaces.
It is important to clean countertops, washbasins, door handles and any surfaces that are frequently touched by hands. Cleaning and disinfecting are very effective at eliminating the virus.

For cleaning, use soap and water or household cleaning products.
For disinfecting, use a bleach solution or a disinfectant. A solution of 1 part bleach to 9 parts water is recommended, that is, 10 mL of bleach in 90 mL of water.
If you are sick, your bed linen, towels, clothes and dishes can be washed with those of other household members using regular detergent. For more information, please visit https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/answers-questions-coronavirus-covid19/#c46787"

what medications should i take to relieve my symptoms,"Over-the-counter medications can be used to relieve the symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Before using, read the labels carefully and do not take more than the recommended dose. You are strongly advised to ask your pharmacist for advice before using over-the-counter medications if you have symptoms. Do not take products that contain the same ingredients at the same time, such as Tylenol® and Tylenol® Sinus. If you have health problems, ask your pharmacist for advice or call Info-Santé 811 before taking over-the-counter medications.

Taking anti-inflammatories may make coronavirus disease (COVID-19) worse, but this information is based on clinical observations and has not been confirmed or disproven. According to some recommendations, ibuprofen should not be taken by people who have COVID-19 to relieve fever. Advil® and Motrin® belong to this drug class. If you are already taking anti-inflammatories and you test positive for COVID-19, speak to your pharmacist, doctor or specialized nurse practitioner.

can employees refuse to work if they think they may be infected with covid,"A worker must take the necessary measures to ensure his health, safety or physical well-being and see that he does not endanger the health, safety or physical well-being of other persons at or near his workplace. A worker who is experiencing symptoms should inform their employer of these symptoms.The employer must ask the worker about the risk factors underlying the need for self-isolation. If the employee refuses to comply, the employer may inform the employee that administrative or disciplinary action may be taken.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government has passed the Quarantine Act. The Act requires that anyone returning from abroad self-isolate for 14 days. Those who fail to comply with this obligation are liable to a fine or imprisonment. For more information, please visit https://www.cnesst.gouv.qc.ca/salle-de-presse/covid-19-info-en/Pages/covid-19.aspx"
what recourses are there for employees whose work may be hazardous to their health,"Workers can file a complaint or report a dangerous situation. Complaints are reviewed to assess the risk and to determine if corrective and control measures are in order. To file a complaint, call the CNESST at 1-844-838-0808 and ask for an on-call inspector.Sections 12–13 of the Act respecting occupational health and safety (AOHS) stipulate that “a worker has a right to refuse to perform particular work if he has reasonable grounds to believe that the performance of that work would expose him to danger to his health, safety or physical well-being, or would expose another person to a similar danger. No worker may, however, exercise his right under section 12 if his refusal to perform the work puts the life, health, safety or physical well-being of another person in immediate danger or if the conditions under which the work is to be performed are ordinary conditions in his kind of work.”Should a worker refuse to work, a CNESST inspector will promptly determine if there is any risk and will make sure that the procedure set out in the AOHS has been followed, i.e., that the worker has notified the immediate superior, the employer or its representative, and informed the union association representative or the prevention representative, as applicable.In addition, the AOHS also provides for the reassignment of pregnant and breastfeeding workers through its For a Safe Maternity Experience Program (FSMEP) and seeks to ensure that pregnant and breastfeeding workers remain safely employed.In view of the current situation, the CNESST is streamlining the FSMEP application procedure to facilitate access and to safeguard the health of pregnant workers and their unborn or breastfed children (see question 36 onward).

what happens if there is a shortage of n respirators,"In the event of such a shortage, there are other types of masks that meet the minimum standards of the N95.However, some of the masks offering equivalent protection may, for example, require additional training and fit testing to ensure a proper seal. A proper fit is necessary to limit infiltration that could expose the worker to the coronavirus.Moreover, it is the employer’s responsibility to ensure that alternative masks meet the appropriate safety standards for the tasks employees are required to perform. If necessary, the employer may contact the manufacturer to confirm whether the masks are compliant.As stipulated in section 51 of the Act respecting occupational health and safety (AOHS), “every employer must take the necessary measures to protect the health and ensure the safety and physical well-being of his worker.” For more information, please visit https://www.cnesst.gouv.qc.ca/salle-de-presse/covid-19-info-en/Pages/covid-19.aspx"
when a worker has been infected with covid does an employer necessarily have to disinfect the workplace or clean common areas in a special way,"If anyone has to use the work area of someone who has had flu-like symptoms, cleaning and disinfection of the surfaces will help limit the spread of the virus within the company. Cleaning the surfaces eliminates dirt. Disinfection kills the remaining microorganisms. According to section 152 of the Regulation respecting occupational health and safety, the word “disinfected” means being washed with a bleach-based solution or with some comparable product. .

how must the employer verify the state of health of the workers arriving on the work site,"Employers must inquire about the health of each of their workers daily, upon arrival at the work site, by having them answer the following questions: Do you have any of these symptoms: cough, fever, difficulty breathing, sudden loss of smell?
Have you been out of the country in the last 2 weeks?
Are you in contact with someone who has COVID-19? If worker answer yes to any of these questions, they must stay home.Temperature taking is not recommended because the results are unreliable, especially for people who work outdoors.It is important to tell workers to go back home if they have symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 , Answers to these questions are confidential and employers must take the necessary steps to ensure their confidentiality For more information, please visit https://www.cnesst.gouv.qc.ca/salle-de-presse/covid-19-info-en/Pages/covid-19.aspx"
what is the time period for an employee who had covid to return to work,"The Direction générale de la santé publique authorizes people to be released from self-isolation once all the following criteria have been met.At least 14 days have elapsed since the onset of the disease in its acute phase
No acute symptoms in the past 24 hours (apart from a possible residual cough)
No fever in the past 48 hours (without using antipyretics) , As a general rule, hospitalization is not required for most people who become infected. Most people should therefore be able to stay at home.However, since the health care system is unable to certify that the above criteria have been met, a medical certificate is not required for a return to work. For more information, please visit https://www.cnesst.gouv.qc.ca/salle-de-presse/covid-19-info-en/Pages/covid-19.aspx"
what is the physical distancing to be respected on the work sites and during transportation of workers,"Employers must make every effort to ensure that work is arranged in such a way that workers can maintain a physical distance of 2 metres from each other.Employers must also take care to ensure that a physical distance of 2 metres is observed during the following situations: arrival at the work site, breaks, meals and departure from the work site, Work must be scheduled in such a manner as to avoid having a large number of workers in the same place at the same time. That said, teams of workers should be kept together,If physical distancing cannot be respected for more than 15 minutes without a physical barrier, measures must be taken to protect the workers (refer to the section on personal protective equipment).Physical distancing may not be possible for a short period due to the nature of the work to be done. Consequently, workers should always avoid touching their face and should cough into their elbow.In terms of transportation, vehicles should be operated at half the seating capacity. Having two workers in the same vehicle is permitted.It is also recommended to avoid face-to-face meetings and to use the telephone or the Internet instead.

what are the hygiene measures to be implemented for construction sites,"Presence of toilets on site , A toilet must be made available to workers from the first day of work. For work sites with 25 workers or more, flushing toilets and sinks are required in accordance with the Safety Code for the construction industry.In fact, a sink containing clean and temperate water must be placed at the disposal of workers for each flushing toilet. It must be maintained in good operating condition.The following products must also be placed at the disposal of workers:Soap or another cleansing agent
A hand dryer, roller towels or paper towels , Where paper towels are used, waste paper baskets, contactless if possible, must be used for their disposa , Other measures to be implemented ,A notice indicating that the water is not suitable as drinking water must be displayed so that it is visible to workers.
For work sites with no more than 24 workers, a chemical toilet may be used.
Toilets must be washed at least twice per work shift—half way through and at the end.
It is important to clean surfaces that workers are likely to touch.Presence of water for hand washing , The employer must ensure that workers have the means to wash their hands at the construction site.
Encouraging hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds should be a priority at the work site.
If soap and water are not available, an alcohol-based gel (60% or more) must be used for at least 20 seconds.
Mobile cleaning units (rentals) are recommended where appropriate. All workers on site must clean their hands:

Upon arriving at and leaving the work site
Before and after eating
Before and after a break
Before smoking
When they go to the toilet ,Keeping the lunch room clean
According to the Safety Code for the construction industry, “on any work site where there are 10 or more workers and where the work lasts more than 7 days, the employer must make a room available to the workers where they may take their meals”.

It is important to clean the lunch room tables before and after each use. The table should be covered with an easily washable surface (plastic or smooth), and the lunch room and its appliances and accessories (refrigerator, microwave, chairs, handles, etc.) should be cleaned every shift to avoid infection.

Depending on how the site is set up, there are many ways to ensure that workers can maintain a social distance of 2 metres between each other during meals: adding trailers, scheduling more than one meal time so workers are not all in the trailer at the same time.

It is also important to leave some space between work clothes hung up in the trailer, and tools, equipment and supplies must not be stored in the lunch room.Tool cleaning
It is recommended that workers do not share tools with each other. If they must, the tools must be disinfected whenever they change hands.

At the end of each shift, it is important to clean and disinfect shared tools and work equipment.

Using gloves does not protect workers against COVID-19. The important thing is to not put your gloves or hands in your face.

According to the public health department, the virus does not penetrate the skin. It is therefore recommended to follow general hygiene practices such as not putting your hands or gloves in your face and washing your hands regularly.

To remove your gloves without becoming infected, it is recommended to follow the procedure provided by Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux For more information, please visit https://www.cnesst.gouv.qc.ca/salle-de-presse/covid-19-info-en/Pages/covid-19.aspx"
what are the preventive measures to be implemented during work on a contaminated site,"When carrying out emergency work (plumbing, electricity, etc.) at a contaminated site, always keep a social distance of at least 2 metres from any infected person. It is important to wash your hands and tools when you leave the site. For more information, please visit https://www.cnesst.gouv.qc.ca/salle-de-presse/covid-19-info-en/Pages/covid-19.aspx"
must workers use personal protective equipment ppe specific to covid on a construction site,"It is not recommended for construction workers to wear specific personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect themselves against COVID-19 when 2-metre physical distancing is respected.If the tasks absolutely must must be performed within 2 metres of another person for for more than 15 minutes without a physical barrier, workers are required to:

If the tasks absolutely must must be performed within 2 metres of another person for for more than 15 minutes without a physical barrier, workers are required to:

Wear a procedure mask (surgical mask) and protective glasses (protective eyewear)
ou

Wear a visor.
Wearing a visor must not represent an additional risk for the worker's safety in performing tasks.

Use of an SCBA (self-contained breathing apparatus) that meets the above-mentioned requirements.

The best thing to do is to wash your hands often and avoid touching your face For more information, please visit https://www.cnesst.gouv.qc.ca/salle-de-presse/covid-19-info-en/Pages/covid-19.aspx"
are there solutions for dealing with covid related stress anxiety and depression,"The whole COVID-19 situation has been a rather strange and unusual development.

what are my responsibilities to my employees if i have to close my business temporarily,"At any time, if you must lay off employees for a period of less than 6 months, you are not obliged to give them a written notice. A verbal notice is permitted. Due to the measures taken by the Government in the context of the pandemic, a verbal notice is also permitted if you must close your business temporarily, regardless of length of this closure,Dismissal or layoff of more than 6 months

If you must dismiss employees (that is, permanently terminate their employment) or lay them off for a period of 6 months or longer, you must give a written notice of termination of employment to the persons who have at least 3 months of uninterrupted service. The deadline in which the notice must be delivered depends on the length of uninterrupted service:

less than 3 months of uninterrupted service: no minimum period
3 months to 1 year of uninterrupted service: 1 week
1 to 5 years 2 weeks
5 to 10 years 4 weeks
11 years or more 8 weeks
If you do not give this written notice, or if you do not give it within the required period, you will have to pay each employee a compensatory indemnity equivalent to his usual wages for a period equal to the period (or the residual period) of the notice to which the employee was entitled. This indemnity must not account for overtime.

This indemnity must be paid, as the case may be, at the time of the dismissal or at the time of the layoff projected for more than six months.

It is also possible that you wish to proceed with layoffs for an indeterminate period because you do not know in advance if the layoffs will extend beyond six months. In this case, you will have to pay the compensatory indemnity after a six-month layoff.

For more details, we invite you to refer to the section of our website concerning the notice of termination of employment

Collective dismissal

There is a collective dismissal if, over a period of 2 consecutive months, you terminate the employment of 10 or more employees of the same establishment, or lay them off for a period of more than 6 months.

In this case, before proceeding with such a dismissal, you must send a notice to the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, within the following minimum deadlines:

nine weeks, when the the number of employees concerned by the dismissal is at least equal to 10 and less than 100;
12 weeks, when the the number of employees concerned by the dismissal is at least equal to 100 and less than 300;
16 weeks, when the the number of employees concerned by the dismissal is at least equal to 300;
You must send a copy of this notice to the Commission des normes, de l'équité, de la santé et de la sécurité du travail and the certified association representing the employees, if one exists. You must also post the notice in your establishment.

At the time of the dismissal, you must pay the dismissed employees all the amounts due to them: wages, overtime, vacation pay (4% or 6%), etc.

All the persons concerned by a notice of collective dismissal must also receive a notice of termination of employment according to the periods provided for by law (indicated above). The persons concerned could be entitled to indemnities if these two notices are not given to them within the required periods. For more information, please visit https://www.cnesst.gouv.qc.ca/salle-de-presse/covid-19-info-en/Pages/covid-19.aspx"
can i demand a medical certificate proving that an employee is not sick,"It is not recommended to go to hospitals or medical clinics at the moment, especially if you are not sick.If you insist that an employee provide a medical certificate, be aware that the associated costs may be considered operating expenses and fringe benefits.

If you ask an employee to be away from work during their shift in order to obtain a medical certificate, you must pay the employee for their time.

The law provides that an employee is deemed to be at work if travelling at the employer’s request. For more information, please visit https://www.cnesst.gouv.qc.ca/salle-de-presse/covid-19-info-en/Pages/covid-19.aspx"
can my employer force me to use my vacation leave or two days of paid sick leave permitted by law,"Your employer cannot force you to take your annual vacation unless they give you at least four weeks’ notice. You have the right to know when your annual vacation is going to start four weeks in advance.As for family- or sickness-related leave days:

There is no clause that would allow an employer to force you to use this leave. That would defeat the purpose of the Act:

Family-related leave is granted to employees who need to be off work for reasons related to the health or education of a child or to the medical condition of a relative (see definition).
Sick leave is granted to employees who need to be off work because they are sick.
It should be noted that no matter the reason (family obligation or sickness), employees are entitled to only two paid days of leave per year. For more information, please visit https://www.cnesst.gouv.qc.ca/salle-de-presse/covid-19-info-en/Pages/covid-19.aspx"
what can i do if i do not receive a record of employment or termination of employment,"At any time, if an employer must lay off employees for a period of less than 6 months, the employer is under no obligation to give them a written notice. A verbal notice is sufficient. Due to government measures taken in response to the pandemic, a verbal notice is also permitted if the employer must close the business temporarily, regardless of length of this closure.If an employer must dismiss employees (that is, permanently terminate their employment) or lay them off for a period of 6 months or longer, the employer must give a written notice of termination of employment to the persons who have at least 3 months of uninterrupted service.

less than 3 months of uninterrupted service: no minimum period
3 months to 1 year of uninterrupted service: 1 week
1 to 5 years 2 weeks
5 to 10 years 4 weeks
10 years or more 8 weeks
Therefore, if you do not receive the notice to which you are entitled or if you receive insufficient notice, your employer must pay you an indemnity equal to your usual salary for the duration (or remaining duration) of the notice to which you are entitled. This indemnity must be paid at the time of the dismissal or at the time of the layoff projected for more than six months.

If your employer refuses to pay you the indemnity to which you are entitled, you can file a complaint with the CNESST.

It should be noted that the notice of termination of employment provided for in the Act respecting labour standards is different from the record of employment that an employer must provide for employment insurance purposes.

are animals responsible for covid in people,"The predominant route of transmission of COVID-19 is from human to human.Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 emerged from an animal source. Genetic sequence data reveals that SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of other CoV found circulating in Rhinolophus bat (Horseshoe Bat) populations. However, to date, there is not enough scientific evidence to identify the source of SARS-CoV-2 or to explain the original route of transmission to humans (which may have involved an intermediate host)..

Investigations are needed to find the source, to determine how the virus entered the human population, and establish the potential role of an animal reservoir in this disease.

Priorities for research to investigate the animal source were discussed by the OIE informal advisory group on COVID-19, now the OIE ad hoc Group on COVID-19 and the human-animal interface, and were presented at the WHO Global Research and Innovation Forum (11-12 February 2020) by the President of the OIE Wildlife Working Group.

can animals be infected with sars cov,"Now that SARS-CoV-2 infections are widely distributed in the human population, there is a possibility for some animals to become infected through close contact with infected humans. Infection of animals with SARS-CoV-2 virus may have implications for animal health and welfare, for wildlife conservation, and for biomedical research.Dogs, cats (domestic cats and a tiger), and minks have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the field setting, following close contact with infected humans (or humans suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2). Further information about these events, which have reported to the OIE, can be found below in the ‘more information’ section.

Studies are underway to better understand the susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2 and to assess infection dynamics in susceptible animal species. To date, preliminary findings from studies suggest that poultry and pigs are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Preliminary findings from laboratory studies suggest that, of the animal species investigated so far, cats are the most susceptible species for SARS-CoV-2, and cats can be affected with clinical disease. In the laboratory setting cats were able to transmit infection to other cats. Ferrets appear to be susceptible to infection but appear to be less affected by clinical disease. In the laboratory setting ferrets were also able to transmit infection to other ferrets. Ferrets might serve as a useful model for future studies e.g. to evaluate vaccines or therapeutics. Dogs appear to be susceptible to infection but appear to be less affected than ferrets or cats. Egyptian fruit bats were also infected in the laboratory setting but did not show signs of disease. The fruit bats did appear to be able to transmit infection to other fruit bats.

The current spread of COVID-19 is a result of human to human transmission. To date, there is no evidence that companion animals play a significant a role in spreading the disease. Therefore, there is no justification in taking measures against companion animals which may compromise their welfare. For more information, please visit https://www.oie.int/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus/"
what precautionary measures should be taken when companion or other animals have close contact with humans suspected or confirmed to be infected with sars cov,"Currently, there is no evidence that animals are playing a significant epidemiological role in the spread of human infections with SARS-CoV-2. However, because animals and people can sometimes share diseases (known as zoonotic diseases), it is still recommended that people who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 limit contact with animals When handling and caring for all animals, basic hygiene measures should always be implemented. This includes hand washing before and after being around or handling animals, their food, or supplies, as well as avoiding kissing, being licked by animals, or sharing food.

People who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 should minimise close direct contact with animals, including farm animals, zoo animals, other captive animals, and wildlife; particularly species which have demonstrated to be susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. As good practice, appropriate and effective biosecurity measures should always be practiced when people have contact with groups of animals e.g. on farms, at zoos, and in animal shelters.

When possible, people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 should avoid close contact with their pets and have another member of their household care for their animals. If they must look after their pets, they should maintain good hygiene practices and wear a face mask if possible. Animals belonging to owners infected with SARS-CoV-2 should be kept indoors as much as possible and contact with those pets should be avoided as much as possible. For more information, please visit https://www.oie.int/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus/"
what can national veterinary services do with regards to companion animals,"Public Health and Veterinary Services should work together using a One Health approach to share information and conduct a risk assessment when a person who is infected with SARS-CoV-2 reports being in contact with companion or other animals.If a decision is made, as a result of a risk assessment, to test a companion animal which has had close contact with a person/owner infected with SARS-CoV-2, it is recommended that RT-PCR be used to test oral, nasal and fecal/rectal samples. Care should be taken to avoid contamination of specimens from the environment or by humans.

Animals that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 should be kept away from unexposed animals and contact with those animals should be avoided as much as possible For more information, please visit https://www.oie.int/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus/"
are there any precautions to take with live animals or animal products,"Although there is uncertainty about the origin of SARS-CoV-2, in accordance with advice offered by the WHO, as a general precaution when visiting live animal markets, wet markets or animal product markets, general hygiene measures should be applied. These include regular hand washing with soap and potable water after touching animals and animal products, as well as avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth, and avoiding contact with sick animals or spoiled animal products. Any contact with other animals possibly living in the market (e.g., stray cats and dogs, rodents, birds, bats) should be avoided. Precaution should be taken to avoid contact with animal waste or fluids on the soil or surfaces of shops and market facilities.Standard recommendations issued by WHO to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose with the elbow when coughing and sneezing and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.  As per general good food safety practices, raw meat, milk or animal organs should be handled with care, to avoid potential cross-contamination with uncooked foods. Meat from healthy livestock that is prepared and served in accordance with good hygiene and food safety principles remains safe to eat. Further recommendations from WHO can be consulted here.

The Codex Alimentarius Commission has adopted several practical guidelines on how to apply and implement best practices to ensure food hygiene (Codex General Principles of Food Hygiene, CXC 1- 1969), handle meats (Codex Code of Hygienic Practice for Meat, CXC 58 – 2005), and control viruses in foods (Guidelines for the Application of General Principles of Food Hygiene to the Control of Viruses in Food (CAC/GL 79-2012) and others which can be consulted on the Codex website.

OIE is actively monitoring SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals, research, and risk analyses with an animal focus, and analysing implications for safe trade in animals and animal products. Based on currently available information, and with the support of expert advisory groups, the OIE makes no specific recommendations for COVID-19 related sanitary measures for the international trade of animals or animal products for countries reporting cases of COVID-19 in humans. Evidence-based risk management principles guide trade in animal species (or their products) demonstrated to be susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus. Evaluation and implementation of risk management for safe trade should follow the principles laid out in Section 2 (Risk Analysis) and Section 5 (Trade Measures, Import/Export Procedures and Veterinary/Health Certification) of the Terrestrial and Aquatic Animal Health Codes. Precautions for packaging materials are unnecessary over and above the observation of basic hygiene, such as ensuring it is clean and free of visible contamination. The report of the OIE ad hoc Group on COVID-19 and Safe Trade in Animals and Animal Products can be consulted here.

what are the veterinary authority s international responsibilities in this event,"The infection of animals with SARS-CoV-2 meets the criteria of an emerging disease.Therefore, any (case of) infection of animals with SARS-CoV-2 should be reported to the OIE in accordance with the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code and include information about the species, diagnostic tests, and relevant epidemiological information.

It is important for Veterinary Authorities to remain informed and maintain close liaison with public health authorities and those responsible for wildlife, to ensure coherent and appropriate risk communication messages and risk management.

It is important that COVID-19 does not lead to inappropriate measures being taken against domestic or wild animals which might compromise their welfare and health or have a negative impact on biodiversity.

In some countries, National Veterinary Services are supporting core functions of the public health response, such as screening and testing of surveillance and diagnostic samples from humans. Veterinary clinics in some countries are also supporting the public health response by donating essential materials such as personal protective equipment and ventilators.

Guidance on Veterinary Laboratory Support to the Public Health Response for COVID-19 is available at the bottom of this document.

The OIE considers Veterinary Services as essential services. Veterinary Authorities can advocate for this within national COVID-19 response plans and operations, to ensure activities related to animal health, animal welfare and veterinary public health risk management continue, under appropriate hygiene protocols, to safeguard the ongoing production of the many and varied goods derived from animals, animal products and animal by-products upon which our societies depend.

what is the oie doing,"The OIE is in contact with its Regional Representations and Sub Regional Representations, OIE Delegates of Member Countries, the OIE Wildlife Working Group, as well as FAO and WHO, to gather and share the latest available information. The OIE is closely liaising with its network of experts involved in current investigations on the source of the disease. Rumours and unofficial information are also monitored daily.The OIE has mobilized several technical working groups (‘ad hoc groups’) to provide scientific advice on research priorities, on-going research, and other implications of COVID-19 for animal health and veterinary public health, including risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication. The OIE has also developed high level guidance for veterinary laboratories working with public health services to support testing of human samples for SARS-CoV-2.

The OIE has put in place an Incident Coordination System to coordinate these activities.

Given the similarities between COVID-19 and the emergence of other human infectious diseases at the human animal interface, the OIE is working with its Wildlife Working Group and other partners to develop a longer term work programme which aims to better understand the dynamics and risks around wildlife trade and consumption, with a view to developing strategies to reduce the risk of future spillover events.

if someone gets the virus and then recovers can that person become infected again or are they immune,"Experts don’t think someone can catch this virus twice but at this point they’re not sure. “That has yet to be answered because we’re so early on in the outbreak,” says Vaisman.There were earlier reports of somebody testing initially positive, then negative and then positive again. Although this may have been due to the fact that the middle negative test was what we call a ‘false negative.’ It wasn’t an accurate test. But we don’t know the answer to that yet. Future research is going to be required.”

It’s possible, for example, that a patient’s immunity to COVID-19 could weaken if the virus mutates. Some viruses, such as influenza, mutate rapidly, which is why people continue catching the flu every year.

“Every year it’s a slightly different virus that we’re talking with,” says Jeff Kwong, a family physician and public-health professor at the University of Toronto. “And we don’t know enough yet about this new coronavirus, if it mutates as quickly as influenza.” For more information, please visit https://globalnews.ca/news/6664297/coronavirus-covid-19-questions-answers-2/"
what happens after my day isolation period is over can i go visit my grandkids,"Now’s not the time to go and visit your other family members,” says Sumontra Chakrabarti, an infectious disease specialist with Mississauga Halton Healthline.“We understand there has to be some essential things, like going to get groceries. Sometimes people have to go to certain types of doctor appointments. But,  if you’re going to go outside, what we recommend is that you keep yourself away, at least two metres, from everybody else.” For more information, please visit https://globalnews.ca/news/6664297/coronavirus-covid-19-questions-answers-2/"
i self isolated because i had symptoms consistent with covid but i m no longer feeling symptoms am i still contagious,"“This is a very good question and it’s a research question,” says Dr. Ronald St. John, the former director-general of the Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response at the Public Health Agency of Canada.“There are some scattered reports of the virus being detected by molecular testing on people who are several days past being discharged from the hospital and who were deemed to be recovered.”

“It looks like that if you start from day one with symptoms, you’re contagious for about eight days,” says Sumontra Chakrabarti.

“One thing that’s important to note, though, is that in the mild cases, the symptoms only lasts for about five to seven days. So it’s possible, even when your symptoms go away, you could have some contagion for a couple of days after that.” For more information, please visit https://globalnews.ca/news/6664297/coronavirus-covid-19-questions-answers-2/"
is loss of smell a symptom of coronavirus particularly in asymptomatic people,"A team of leading ear, nose and throat doctors in the U.K. have warned that people experiencing the loss of smell or taste could be “hidden carriers” of the virus, capable of spreading it without realizing. They compiled data from a number of countries, including Germany and South Korea, that found a growing number of patients with little to no other symptoms aside from losing the sense of smell.But a diminished sense of taste and smell can be symptomatic of a wide variety of illnesses, and isn’t definitive of COVID-19 at this point, according to Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist based out of Toronto General Hospital.
“I doubt this is a very specific feature of COVID-19. It might be a feature, but likely not a uniquely distinctive one compared to other infections,” he said.
Bogoch said it’s not unreasonable that people with the new coronavirus could see a decrease in their sense of smell, but said on the scale of symptom importance, it’s “minimal.”
“It’s a common symptom in many infections. It’s usually extremely mild,” he said. “If people truly have no other symptoms at all, I don’t think it would be wise to start rushing to testing centres.” For more information, please visit https://globalnews.ca/news/6664297/coronavirus-covid-19-questions-answers-2/"
do we know anything about the consequences of the virus on pregnant women and on the fetus,"“We don’t know yet about the effect of the virus on the fetus or on the pregnant woman,” says infectious disease expert Alon Vaisman. “But so far, the evidence has been very reassuring that there hasn’t been transmission from mom to baby.” COVID-19 has had remarkably little impact on babies and children, but they can become infected. A newborn baby in London reportedly tested positive for coronavirus just minutes after birth. The child’s mother had been admitted to hospital days earlier with suspected pneumonia. It’s not known whether the child contracted the disease in the womb or was infected during birth.

Vaisman says a pregnant woman’s weakened immune system and regular check-ups may put them at a higher risk of being exposed to the virus. “When it comes to pregnant women, these (medical) appointments are absolutely necessary to make sure everything’s OK. The only thing we could recommend is to avoid contact with people as much within reason.” For more information, please visit https://globalnews.ca/news/6664297/coronavirus-covid-19-questions-answers-2/"
how will covid respond to the warmer spring summer weather we are fast approaching,"Seasonal influenza thrives in the northern hemisphere during the winter and then tapers off in the warmer spring and summer months. But experts aren’t sure whether COVID-19 will follow a similar pattern.“Nobody has any idea what the spread of this virus is going to do when it gets warmer,” says Michael Gardam, Chief of Staff at Humber River Hospital. “There have been some theories that perhaps it will behave like influenza. However, given the spread of this around the world, in many parts of the world that are warmer than here, I think we need to put that whole ‘it’s all going to go away in the summer’ thing to rest.”
Countries in the middle of summer, such as Australia and Brazil, reported dozens of cases of COVID-19. Singapore, where it’s hot and humid most of the year, has confirmed more than 100 cases.
“I think it’s very likely we’re going to continue to see spread over the summer. Now, might the spread slow down a bit? Maybe. But it’s going to be very hard to measure that. For more information, please visit https://globalnews.ca/news/6664297/coronavirus-covid-19-questions-answers-2/"
what should i do if i develop symptoms consistent with covid,"Symptoms of the new coronavirus include a fever, dry cough, fatigue and shortness of breath. But if you develop these symptoms, it’s still unlikely that you’re infected with COVID-19.It’s important to recognize that, right now, we’re in respiratory virus season. The symptoms of COVID-19 will be similar to all the symptoms that you’d experience from other respiratory viruses,” explains Alon Vaisman, an infectious disease expert with the University Health Network in Toronto.

“The highest risk individuals are those who’ve travelled recently or been exposed to somebody who is confirmed to be infected.” For more information, please visit https://globalnews.ca/news/6664297/coronavirus-covid-19-questions-answers-2/"
how to protect yourself,"Vaisman notes that most hospitals and community centres in Canada are still only testing those who have recently travelled abroad or had direct exposure to someone diagnosed with COVID-19.“If you’re experiencing respiratory symptoms or fever, you’re most likely explanation is not COVID-19. However, the likelihood of that will change depending on what happens in Canada and whether we start seeing increases in community transmission.” For more information, please visit https://globalnews.ca/news/6664297/coronavirus-covid-19-questions-answers-2/"
what are the chances of dying from covid,"We still don’t know exactly how deadly this disease is. Globally, about 3.4 per cent of reported COVID-19 cases have died, according to the World Health Organisation’s briefing on March 3. But the actual mortality rate may be much lower.“Most of those numbers are coming from Hubei Province, where they were overwhelmed with this. And so their mortality rate is artificially high,” says Michael Gardam, Chief of Staff at Humber River Hospital.

Because symptoms can be mild and many cases are likely going undiagnosed, experts believe the real mortality (or death) rate is closer to one per cent. South Korea, for example, rolled out a mass public testing programme, with as many as 10,000 new tests conducted per day. The mortality rate there has remained below one per cent.

Italy has seen a mortality rate closer to five per cent, but it also has the oldest population in Europe, with about a quarter of its residents aged 65 or older. For more information, please visit https://globalnews.ca/news/6664297/coronavirus-covid-19-questions-answers-2/"
who is most at risk,"The older you are, the more likely you are to have a rougher course with this infection,” says infectious disease expert Isaac Bogoch.In Italy, for example, the average age of those who have died was 81, according to Italy’s national health institute on March 5. And many of the victims had preexisting health conditions.In China, the official mortality rate was 14.8 per cent in people 80 or older, compared with an overall national mortality rate of 2.3 per cent.

“So it certainly can take its toll on older people. Now, if someone is 80-years-old and they get this infection, is it certain that they are going to die? Of course not. It’s a risk factor.” For more information, please visit https://globalnews.ca/news/6664297/coronavirus-covid-19-questions-answers-2/"
are children at risk,"Children can become infected with COVID-19 but appear to carry a much lower risk of developing severe symptoms. Fewer than one per cent of confirmed cases in China were nine years or younger and there were no reported deaths. “It is a bit of a mystery. I don’t think we fully understand why that is the case,” says Vaisman.

“It’s a respiratory infection and people with the most vulnerable lungs tend to be the very youngest and the very oldest. So it is mysterious as to why very young people are not affected the same way that we would see with other viruses.”

While unexplained, it’s also not unusual: children fare better at managing many other infectious diseases, such as chickenpox and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome).

That said, health officials remain concerned about the potential for children to spread the coronavirus to others, particularly since their symptoms are typically mild and cases can go undiagnosed. “They’re considered a real threat to others because they’re sick, but not that sick. And they can spread it to other people,” says Gardam For more information, please visit https://globalnews.ca/news/6664297/coronavirus-covid-19-questions-answers-2/"
what if i have an underlying medical condition or weakened immune system,"The answer depends, of course, on the severity of a person’s existing health issue. “Not all underlying medical conditions are created equal,” says Bogoch.“If someone has mild asthma, they may have a bit of a rougher course with this infection, though likely not. But if someone has, for example, really hard-to-manage COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), this infection can certainly cause some damage.”

Other underlying conditions associated with severe cases of COVID-19 have included high blood pressure or hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. For more information, please visit https://globalnews.ca/news/6664297/coronavirus-covid-19-questions-answers-2/"
we have a spring break trip scheduled to california at what point would you consider cancelling it,"If you’re wondering whether to cancel travel plans, health officials say your first stop should be the Government of Canada’s travel advisory webpage. Be sure to check the advisories for both your destination and any stopover locations along the way.The website currently recommends avoiding all travel on cruise ships, for example. Vaisman says seniors or those with underlying health conditions might want to reconsider any trip outside the country, including to the United States. “Really think about whether that travel is necessary because they are considered ‘at-risk’.”“If you go out and travel somewhere, even if it’s the United States and you become unwell, how’s that going to affect your family? How’s it going to affect your job? How’s it going to affect your colleagues at work? Because if you do require quarantine, it’s going to have a pretty significant effect on the quality of your life and the people close to you.”

Gardam says he’s personally decided to cancel all travel plans outside of Canada for the foreseeable future. “We’re seeing people’s vacations getting screwed up. I don’t want my vacations screwed up. I have no interest in travelling to someplace and then finding out I have to be in quarantine, or the place I’m staying has been put in lockdown, or my flights have been cancelled or whatever else. I don’t want to deal with that. For more information, please visit https://globalnews.ca/news/6664297/coronavirus-covid-19-questions-answers-2/"
i have tickets to a basketball game should i cancel those plans and avoid large crowds,"Health experts are stressing the importance of avoiding large gatherings as an effective means of curtailing the outbreak. “When you increase the likelihood of transmission by having people close together, then you’re potentially going to run into trouble, especially you’re talking about things that are non-essential, like parades or concerts,” says Vaisman. “All it takes is a few individuals who have the virus. All of a sudden you have a few transmission events and then the virus just kind of explodes from there.”The coronavirus is understood to have a “reproductive number” between two and 2.5, meaning each sick person is infecting at least two other people. “So that’s enough to say it’s quick exponential growth,” says Jeffrey Rosenthal, a professor of statistical sciences at the University of Toronto. “There’s definitely the potential for there to be a lot more cases because it is quite contagious.”The majority of cases are mild, which has helped to fuel the spread. “That may be why this outbreak has become so severe,” says Bogoch. “Many people who are mildly symptomatic are well enough to leave the house, well enough to travel and therefore transmit to other people. And that perhaps is one of the biggest contributors to this problem.”Canada’s Minister of Health Patty Hajdu said on March 11 that the government anticipates between 30 and 70 per cent of Canada’s population will contract the virus. For more information, please visit https://globalnews.ca/news/6664297/coronavirus-covid-19-questions-answers-2/"
are people contagious before their symptoms appear how long do symptoms last,"Once someone contracts COVID-19, it typically takes around four or five days before they start showing symptoms. But they can be contagious before that.“People will probably shed (or spread) the virus for about a day or so before they feel sick,” says Bogoch. “That’s common with all viruses.”

“If you’re an otherwise healthy person, you may find the illness passes after a few days. Although people who are unwell, for example, or who have (underlying health conditions) like diabetes or heart disease, or the elderly, will have a much worse outcome and may experience more severe side effects, such that on around ‘Day 7’ they may require admission to hospital.” For more information, please visit https://globalnews.ca/news/6664297/coronavirus-covid-19-questions-answers-2/"
do masks protect against the virus,"Yes and no. If you’re sick, a surgical mask can help prevent you from spreading the virus to others. But if you’re not sick, it’s unlikely to offer much protection.“Walking around the city wearing a mask intermittently? There’s no evidence to say that that’s going to help you,” says Gardam.

“You’d have to be wearing that mask 24/7 to not potentially get infected and never touch it and move it around. And you probably shouldn’t eat either, because you’ve got to take it off when you do that. And you should have eye protection as well. So a mask on its own, it really doesn’t make any sense.” For more information, please visit https://globalnews.ca/news/6664297/coronavirus-covid-19-questions-answers-2/"
do the pneumonia vaccine or the flu shot protect against the virus,"The flu shot and the pneumonia (or pneumococcal) vaccine, which is a routine immunization for infants and people 65 and older, won’t protect against COVID-19. But they can help patients avoid contracting those illnesses as a result of weakened immune system from COVID-19. In severe cases, the novel coronvirus may cause pneumonia and lead to respiratory failure. For more information, please visit https://globalnews.ca/news/6664297/coronavirus-covid-19-questions-answers-2/"
should governments close schools to slow the spread of the virus,"School closures, such as the Ontario Government’s decision to cancel classes for elementary and high school students until April 6, can cause significant disruption. But health experts note that temperately closing classrooms has proved to be one of the most effective tools in curtailing a contagion. “There’s certainly evidence from other respiratory viruses that children are a big incubator of this. And they’re also the ones that are very good at spreading it to other people,” says Michael Gardam, Chief of Staff at Humber River Hospital. 

Parents won’t be surprised to hear that children are considered “super spreaders” of respiratory illnesses. But that may prove particularly true in the case of COVID-19, because the majority of children’s symptoms thus far have been very mild and, as a result, more difficult to detect.

“So based on that evidence, I think most places have thought about closing schools,” Gardam says. 

The WHO reported in February that 2.4 per cent of COVID-19 cases involved children and just 0.2 per cent were children who became critically ill. For more information, please visit https://globalnews.ca/news/6664297/coronavirus-covid-19-questions-answers-2/"
covid symptoms when they occur vary widely and undertesting means many people have probably been unwittingly infected,"Covid-19 symptoms vary widely, and undertesting in many countries means that many people may have already had the coronavirus without having received a positive diagnosis. Is it possible to find out For more information, please visit https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-have-i-already-had-covid-19"
is there any way to know whether someone has had covid in the past,"Dr William Hillmann: Antibody tests are being developed but are not in widespread clinical use yet. The antibody testing would allow us to check blood samples for antibodies against coronavirus to tell whether somebody has had it. I, and I think many others, are anxiously awaiting for those to become available. For more information, please visit https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-have-i-already-had-covid-20"
could i have had it and been asymptomatic,"Hillmann: Coronavirus is actually quite a significant spectrum of symptoms, from people who are entirely asymptomatic and would have no idea that they have it to people with very mild, cold-like symptoms – runny nose, congestion, sore throat – to people with more flu-like symptoms – high fevers, muscle aches, shortness of breath and cough. Loss of smell and taste are also symptoms. All the way up to people with severe illness, who we’re seeing in the hospital with respiratory failure, requiring ICU care,It’s impossible right now to say what the true prevalence of the disease in the US is since we are still prioritizing testing for people who are sick or in the hospital or who are healthcare workers. We’re not doing widespread testing that South Korea and some European countries have done to get a sense of how many people are asymptomatic or have such minimal symptoms that they attribute it to allergies or something else. For more information, please visit https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-have-i-already-had-covid-21"
are people who are asymptomatic also contagious,"Hillmann: A significant proportion of people who are totally asymptomatic are contagious for some portion of time. We just don’t know [for how long] at this point, because we don’t have the kind of testing available to screen for asymptomatic infections.When people are symptomatic, they’re contagious. A day or two before they become symptomatic, they’re likely contagious as well. A virus builds up and starts to shed, and then after symptoms resolve, people can still be contagious for a couple of days. We have some evidence of viral shed even a couple of weeks after symptoms are resolved. It’s hard to know if that’s actual live virus, which is still able to infect somebody, or if that’s just dead virus that the body is shedding.

should someone behave differently if they think but don t know for certain that they have already had it,"Dr David Buchholz: We all have to be role models. If we’re all in it together, we all should be doing social distancing.Hillmann: Since there’s no real way to know at this point who might have had it, unless you’re symptomatic, you get a swab and are definitively diagnosed with it, I would just act as if you hadn’t had it. Keep doing all of those things that we all should be doing at this point: social distancing and hand hygiene. I think universal mask-wearing in public is a reasonable recommendation based on what we know about the wide spectrum of symptoms, and the fact that people can be asymptomatic and still be shedding the virus. For more information, please visit https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-have-i-already-had-covid-23"
if i think i may have had it do i have an ethical obligation to tell people i came in contact with even if it may in fact just have been a cold,"Buchholz: I would, absolutely. I’m in New York, and it was definitely in the community before we knew it. So, yeah, any family members and close friends, maybe somebody you work next to, I think I would just alert them, especially if it was in the last 14 days. If it’s been more than 14 days, they would have gotten sick by now if they had significant exposure.Hillmann: It’s up to every individual about what they feel is right. That being said, with the surge in infections that we’re seeing in places like New York, if you were symptomatic at one point but were not tested, and you were in close contact with somebody, I think you should tell them. For more information, please visit https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-have-i-already-had-covid-24"
if i ve had it can i get it again,"Buchholz: There’s not been any evidence that anyone’s gotten it more than once. Someone with a normal immune system that can react to the virus and get better should have immunity for quite some time, at least a year, if not lifelong.There have been reports out of China suggesting people are testing positive for Covid-19 a second time. Most scientists think it is an issue around the inaccuracy of the testing and not that people are having two separate cases of the disease.

what is coronavirus,"Coronaviruses are an extremely common cause of colds and other upper respiratory infections. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-basics"
how many people have covid,"The numbers are changing rapidly.

The most up-to-date information is available from the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Johns Hopkins University.

It has spread so rapidly and to so many countries that the World Health Organization has declared it a pandemic (a term indicating that it has affected a large population, region, country, or continent). For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-basics"
do adults younger than who are otherwise healthy need to worry about covid,"Yes, they do. Though people younger than 65 are much less likely to die from COVID-19, they can get sick enough from the disease to require hospitalization. According to a report published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) in late March, nearly 40% of people hospitalized for COVID-19 between mid-February and mid-March were between the ages of 20 and 54. Drilling further down by age, MMWR reported that 20% of hospitalized patients and 12% of COVID-19 patients in ICUs were between the ages of 20 and 44.

People of any age should take preventive health measures like frequent hand washing, physical distancing, and wearing a mask when going out in public, to help protect themselves and to reduce the chances of spreading the infection to others. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-basics"
can covid symptoms worsen rapidly after several days of illness,"Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, fatigue, loss of appetite, loss of smell, and body ache. In some people, COVID-19 causes more severe symptoms like high fever, severe cough, and shortness of breath, which often indicates pneumonia.

A person may have mild symptoms for about one week, then worsen rapidly. Let your doctor know if your symptoms quickly worsen over a short period of time. Also call the doctor right away if you or a loved one with COVID-19 experience any of the following emergency symptoms: trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to arouse the person, or bluish lips or face. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-basics"
one of the symptoms of covid is shortness of breath what does that mean,"Shortness of breath refers to unexpectedly feeling out of breath, or winded. But when should you worry about shortness of breath? There are many examples of temporary shortness of breath that are not worrisome. For example, if you feel very anxious, it's common to get short of breath and then it goes away when you calm down.

However, if you find that you are ever breathing harder or having trouble getting air each time you exert yourself, you always need to call your doctor. That was true before we had the recent outbreak of COVID-19, and it will still be true after it is over.

Meanwhile, it's important to remember that if shortness of breath is your only symptom, without a cough or fever, something other than COVID-19 is the likely problem. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-basics"
does covid cause strokes what about blood clots in other parts of the body,"Strokes occur when the brain's blood supply is interrupted, usually by a blood clot. Recently, there have been reports of a greater-than-expected number of younger patients being hospitalized for, and sometimes dying from, serious strokes. These strokes are happening in patients who test positive for coronavirus but who do not have any traditional risk factors for stroke. They tend to have no COVID-19 symptoms, or only mild symptoms. The type of stroke occurring in these patients typically occurs in much older patients.

COVID-related strokes occur because of a bodywide increase in blood clot formation, which can damage any organ, not just the brain. A blood clot in the lungs is called pulmonary embolism and can cause shortness of breath, chest pain, or death; a blood clot in or near the heart can cause a heart attack; and blood clots in the kidneys can cause kidney damage requiring dialysis.

We don't yet know if the coronavirus itself stimulates blood clots to form, or if they are a result of an overactive immune response to the virus. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-basics"
can covid affect brain function,"COVID-19 does appear to affect brain function in some people. Specific neurological symptoms seen in people with COVID-19 include loss of smell, inability to taste, muscle weakness, tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, dizziness, confusion, delirium, seizures, and stroke.

One study that looked at 214 people with moderate to severe COVID-19 in Wuhan, China found that about one-third of those patients had one or more neurological symptoms. Neurological symptoms were more common in people with more severe disease.

Neurological symptoms have also been seen in COVID-19 patients in the US and around the world. Some people with neurological symptoms tested positive for COVID-19 but did not have any respiratory symptoms like coughing or difficulty breathing; others experienced both neurological and respiratory symptoms.

Experts do not know how the coronavirus causes neurological symptoms. They may be a direct result of infection or an indirect consequence of inflammation or altered oxygen and carbon dioxide levels caused by the virus.

The CDC has added ""new confusion or inability to rouse"" to its list of emergency warning signs that should prompt you to get immediate medical attention. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-basics"
is a lost sense of smell a symptom of covid what should i do if i lose my sense of smell,"Increasing evidence suggests that a lost sense of smell, known medically as anosmia, may be a symptom of COVID-19. This is not surprising, because viral infections are a leading cause of loss of sense of smell, and COVID-19 is a caused by a virus. Still, loss of smell might help doctors identify people who do not have other symptoms, but who might be infected with the COVID-19 virus — and who might be unwittingly infecting others.

A statement written by a group of ear, nose and throat specialists (otolaryngologists) in the United Kingdom reported that in Germany, two out of three confirmed COVID-19 cases had a loss of sense of smell; in South Korea, 30% of people with mild symptoms who tested positive for COVID-19 reported anosmia as their main symptom.

On March 22nd, the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery recommended that anosmia be added to the list of COVID-19 symptoms used to screen people for possible testing or self-isolation.

In addition to COVID-19, loss of smell can also result from allergies as well as other viruses, including rhinoviruses that cause the common cold. So anosmia alone does not mean you have COVID-19. Studies are being done to get more definitive answers about how common anosmia is in people with COVID-19, at what point after infection loss of smell occurs, and how to distinguish loss of smell caused by COVID-19 from loss of smell caused by allergies, other viruses, or other causes altogether.

Until we know more, tell your doctor right away if you find yourself newly unable to smell. He or she may prompt you to get tested and to self-isolate. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-basics"
how long is it between when a person is exposed to the virus and when they start showing symptoms,"Recently published research found that on average, the time from exposure to symptom onset (known as the incubation period) is about five to six days. However, studies have shown that symptoms could appear as soon as three days after exposure to as long as 13 days later. These findings continue to support the CDC recommendation of self-quarantine and monitoring of symptoms for 14 days post exposure. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-basics"
how deadly is covid,"The answer depends on whether you're looking at the fatality rate (the risk of death among those who are infected) or the total number of deaths. So far, influenza has caused far more total deaths this flu season, both in the US and worldwide, than COVID-19. This is why you may have heard it said that the flu is a bigger threat.

Regarding the fatality rate, it appears that the risk of death with the pandemic coronavirus infection (commonly estimated at about 1%) is far less than it was for SARS (approximately 11%) and MERS (about 35%), but will likely be higher than the risk from seasonal flu (which averages about 0.1%). We will have a more accurate estimate of fatality rate for this coronavirus infection once testing becomes more available.

What we do know so far is the risk of death very much depends on your age and your overall health. Children appear to be at very low risk of severe disease and death. Older adults and those who smoke or have chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, or lung disease have a higher chance of developing complications like pneumonia, which could be deadly. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-basics"
will warm weather slow or stop the spread of covid,"Some viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more when the weather is colder. But it is still possible to become sick with these viruses during warmer months.

At this time, we do not know for certain whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when the weather warms up. But a new report suggests that warmer weather may not have much of an impact.

The report, published in early April by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, summarized research that looked at how well the COVID-19 coronavirus survives in varying temperatures and humidity levels, and whether the spread of this coronavirus may slow in warmer and more humid weather.

The report found that in laboratory settings, higher temperatures and higher levels of humidity decreased survival of the COVID-19 coronavirus. However, studies looking at viral spread in varying climate conditions in the natural environment had inconsistent results.

The researchers concluded that conditions of increased heat and humidity alone may not significantly slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-basics"
how long can the coronavirus stay airborne i have read different estimates,"A study done by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' Laboratory of Virology in the Division of Intramural Research in Hamilton, Montana helps to answer this question. The researchers used a nebulizer to blow coronaviruses into the air. They found that infectious viruses could remain in the air for up to three hours. The results of the study were published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 17, 2020. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-basics"
how long can the coronavirus that causes covid survive on surfaces,"A recent study found that the COVID-19 coronavirus can survive up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard, and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The researchers also found that this virus can hang out as droplets in the air for up to three hours before they fall. But most often they will fall more quickly.

There's a lot we still don't know, such as how different conditions, such as exposure to sunlight, heat, or cold, can affect these survival times.

As we learn more, continue to follow the CDC's recommendations for cleaning frequently touched surfaces and objects every day. These include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables.

If surfaces are dirty, first clean them using a detergent and water, then disinfect them. A list of products suitable for use against COVID-19 is available here. This list has been pre-approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use during the COVID-19 outbreak.

In addition, wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water after bringing in packages, or after trips to the grocery store or other places where you may have come into contact with infected surfaces. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-basics"
should i accept packages from china,"There is no reason to suspect that packages from China harbor coronavirus. Remember, this is a respiratory virus similar to the flu. We don't stop receiving packages from China during their flu season. We should follow that same logic for the virus that causes COVID-19. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-basics"
can i catch the coronavirus by eating food handled or prepared by others,"We are still learning about transmission of the new coronavirus. It's not clear if it can be spread by an infected person through food they have handled or prepared, but if so it would more likely be the exception than the rule.

That said, the new coronavirus is a respiratory virus known to spread by upper respiratory secretions, including airborne droplets after coughing or sneezing. The virus that causes COVID-19 has also been detected in the stool of certain people. So we currently cannot rule out the possibility of the infection being transmitted through food by an infected person who has not thoroughly washed their hands. In the case of hot food, the virus would likely be killed by cooking. This may not be the case with uncooked foods like salads or sandwiches. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-basics"
the flu kills more people than covid at least so far why are we so worried about covid shouldn t we be more focused on preventing deaths from the flu,"You're right to be concerned about the flu. Fortunately, the same measures that help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus — frequent and thorough handwashing, not touching your face, coughing and sneezing into a tissue or your elbow, avoiding people who are sick, and staying away from people if you're sick — also help to protect against spread of the flu.

If you do get sick with the flu, your doctor can prescribe an antiviral drug that can reduce the severity of your illness and shorten its duration. There are currently no antiviral drugs available to treat COVID-19. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-basics"
should i get a flu shot,"While the flu shot won't protect you from developing COVID-19, it's still a good idea. Most people older than six months can and should get the flu vaccine. Doing so reduces the chances of getting seasonal flu. Even if the vaccine doesn't prevent you from getting the flu, it can decrease the chance of severe symptoms. But again, the flu vaccine will not protect you against this coronavirus. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-basics"
what can i do to protect myself and others from covid,"The following actions help prevent the spread of COVID-19, as well as other coronaviruses and influenza:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces every day. High touch surfaces include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables. A list of products suitable for use against COVID-19 is available here. This list has been pre-approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Wash your hands often with soap and water. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus"
what do i need to know about washing my hands effectively,"Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; and after handling anything that's come from outside your home.

If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.
Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
The CDC's handwashing website has detailed instructions and a video about effective handwashing procedures. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus"
how does coronavirus spread,"The coronavirus is thought to spread mainly from person to person. This can happen between people who are in close contact with one another. Droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes may land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby, or possibly be inhaled into their lungs.

A person infected with coronavirus — even one with no symptoms — may emit aerosols when they talk or breathe. Aerosols are infectious viral particles that can float or drift around in the air for up to three hours. Another person can breathe in these aerosols and become infected with the coronavirus. This is why everyone should cover their nose and mouth when they go out in public.

Coronavirus can also spread from contact with infected surfaces or objects. For example, a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus"
how could contact tracing help slow the spread of covid,"Anyone who comes into close contact with someone who has COVID-19 is at increased risk of becoming infected themselves, and of potentially infecting others. Contact tracing can help prevent further transmission of the virus by quickly identifying and informing people who may be infected and contagious, so they can take steps to not infect others.

Contact tracing begins with identifying everyone that a person recently diagnosed with COVID-19 has been in contact with since they became contagious. In the case of COVID-19, a person may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before they started to experience symptoms.

The contacts are notified about their exposure. They may be told what symptoms to look out for, advised to isolate themselves for a period of time, and to seek medical attention as needed if they start to experience symptoms. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus"
what is social distancing and why is it important,"The COVID-19 virus primarily spreads when one person breathes in droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. In addition, any infected person, with or without symptoms, could spread the virus by touching a surface. The coronavirus could remain on that surface and someone else could touch it and then touch their mouth, nose or eyes. That's why it's so important to try to avoid touching public surfaces or at least try to wipe them with a disinfectant.

Social distancing refers to actions taken to stop or slow down the spread of a contagious disease. For an individual, it refers to maintaining enough distance (6 feet or more) between yourself and another person to avoid getting infected or infecting someone else. School closures, directives to work from home, library closings, and cancelling meetings and larger events help enforce social distancing at a community level.

Slowing down the rate and number of new coronavirus infections is critical to reduce the risk that large numbers of critically ill patients cannot receive life-saving care. Highly realistic projections show that unless we begin extreme social distancing now — every day matters — our hospitals and other healthcare facilities will not be able to handle the likely influx of patients. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus"
what precautions can i take when grocery shopping,"The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through droplets containing virus, or through viral particles that float in the air. The virus may be breathed in directly and can also spread when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touches their mouth, nose, or eyes. There is no current evidence that the COVID-19 virus is transmitted through food.

Safety precautions help you avoid breathing in coronavirus or touching a contaminated surface and touching your face.

In the grocery store, maintain at least six feet of distance between yourself and other shoppers. Wipe frequently touched surfaces like grocery carts or basket handles with disinfectant wipes. Avoid touching your face. Wearing a cloth mask helps remind you not to touch your face and can further help reduce spread of the virus. Use hand sanitizer before leaving the store. Wash your hands as soon as you get home.

If you are older than 65 or at increased risk for any reason, limit trips to the grocery store. Ask a neighbor or friend to pick up groceries and leave them outside your house. See if your grocery store offers special hours for older adults or those with underlying conditions. Or have groceries delivered to your home. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus"
what precautions can i take when unpacking my groceries,"Recent studies have shown that the COVID-19 virus may remain on surfaces or objects for up to 72 hours. This means virus on the surface of groceries will become inactivated over time after groceries are put away. If you need to use the products before 72 hours, consider washing the outside surfaces or wiping them with disinfectant. The contents of sealed containers won't be contaminated.

After unpacking your groceries, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Wipe surfaces on which you placed groceries while unpacking them with household disinfectants.

Thoroughly rinse fruits and vegetables with water before consuming. And wash your hands before consuming any foods that you've recently brought home from the grocery store. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus"
what should and shouldn t i do during this time to avoid exposure to and spread of this coronavirus for example what steps should i take if i need to go shopping for food and staples what about eating at restaurants ordering takeout going to the gym or swimming in a public pool,"The answer to all of the above is that it is critical that everyone begin intensive social distancing immediately. As much as possible, limit contact with people outside your family.

If you need to get food, staples, medications or healthcare, try to stay at least six feet away from others, and wash your hands thoroughly after the trip, avoiding contact with your face and mouth throughout. Prepare your own food as much as possible. If you do order takeout, open the bag, box or containers, then wash your hands. Lift, fork or spoon out the contents into your own dishes. After you dispose of these outside containers, wash your hands again. Most restaurants, gyms and public pools are closed; but even if one is open, now is not the time to go.

Here are some other things to avoid: playdates, parties, sleepovers, having friends or family over for meals or visits, and going to coffee shops — essentially any nonessential activity that involves close contact with others. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus"
what can i do when social distancing,"Try to look at this period of social distancing as an opportunity to get to things you've been meaning to do.

Though you shouldn't go to the gym right now, that doesn't mean you can't exercise. Take long walks or run outside (do your best to maintain at least six feet between you and non-family members when you're outside). Do some yoga or other indoor exercise routines when the weather isn't cooperating.

Kids need exercise too, so try to get them outside every day for walks or a backyard family soccer game (remember, this isn't the time to invite the neighborhood kids over to play). Avoid public playground structures, which aren't cleaned regularly and can spread the virus.

Pull out board games that are gathering dust on your shelves. Have family movie nights. Catch up on books you've been meaning to read, or do a family read-aloud every evening.

It's important to stay connected even though we should not do so in person. Keep in touch virtually through phone calls, Skype, video, and other social media. Enjoy a leisurely chat with an old friend you've been meaning to call.

If all else fails, go to bed early and get some extra sleep! For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus"
should i wear a face mask,"The CDC now recommends that everyone in the US wear nonsurgical masks when going out in public.

Coronavirus primarily spreads when someone breathes in droplets containing virus that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes or when a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth. But people who are infected but do not have symptoms, or have not yet developed symptoms, can also infect others. That's where masks come in.

A person infected with coronavirus — even one with no symptoms — may emit aerosols when they talk or breathe. Aerosols are infectious viral particles that can float or drift around in the air. Another person can breathe in these aerosols and become infected with the virus. A mask can help prevent that spread. An article published in NEJM in March reported that aerosolized coronavirus could remain in the air for up to three hours.

What kind of mask should you wear? Because of the short supply, people without symptoms or without exposure to someone known to be infected with the coronavirus can wear a cloth face covering over their nose and mouth. They do help prevent others from becoming infected if you happen to be carrying the virus unknowingly.

While N95 masks are the most effective, these medical-grade masks are in short supply and should be reserved for healthcare workers.

Some parts of the US also have inadequate supplies of surgical masks. If you have a surgical mask, you may need to reuse it at this time. But never share your mask.

Surgical masks are preferred if you are caring for someone who has COVID-19 or you have any respiratory symptoms (even mild symptoms) and must go out in public.

Masks are more effective when they are tight-fitting and cover your entire nose and mouth. They can help discourage you from touching your face (be sure you're not touching your face more often to adjust the mask). Masks are meant to be used in addition to, not instead of, physical distancing. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus"
is it safe to travel by airplane,"Stay current on travel advisories from regulatory agencies. This is a rapidly changing situation.

Anyone who has a fever and respiratory symptoms should not fly if at all possible. Even if a person has symptoms that feel like just a cold, he or she should wear a mask on an airplane. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus"
is there a vaccine available,"No vaccine is available, although scientists will be starting human testing on a vaccine very soon. However, it may be a year or more before we even know if we have a vaccine that works. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus"
can a person who has had coronavirus get infected again,"While we don't know the answer yet, most people would likely develop at least short-term immunity to the specific coronavirus that causes COVID-19. However, that immunity could diminish over time and you would still be susceptible to a different coronavirus infection. Or, this particular virus could mutate, just like the influenza virus does each year. Often these mutations change the virus enough to make you susceptible, because your immune system thinks it is an infection that it has never seen before. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus"
will a pneumococcal vaccine help protect me against coronavirus,"Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, only help protect people from these specific bacterial infections. They do not protect against any coronavirus pneumonia, including pneumonia that may be part of COVID-19. However, even though these vaccines do not specifically protect against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, they are highly recommended to protect against other respiratory illnesses. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus"
my husband and i are in our s i m otherwise healthy my husband is doing well but does have heart disease and diabetes my grandkids school has been closed for the next several weeks we d like to help out by watching our grandkids but don t know if that would be safe for us can you offer some guidance,"People who are older and older people with chronic medical conditions, especially cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and lung disease are more likely to have severe disease or death from COVID-19, and should engage in strict social distancing without delay. This is also the case for people or who are immunocompromised because of a condition or treatment that weakens their immune response.

The decision to provide on-site help with your children and grandchildren is a difficult one. If there is an alternative to support their needs without being there, that would be safest. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus"
can my pet infect me with the virus that causes covid,"At present, there is no evidence that pets such as dogs or cats can spread the COVID-19 virus to humans. However, pets can spread other infections that cause illness, including E. coli and Salmonella, so wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after interacting with pets. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus"
what can i do to keep my immune system strong,"Your immune system is your body's defense system. When a harmful invader — like a cold or flu virus, or the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 — gets into your body, your immune system mounts an attack. Known as an immune response, this attack is a sequence of events that involves various cells and unfolds over time.

Following general health guidelines is the best step you can take toward keeping your immune system strong and healthy. Every part of your body, including your immune system, functions better when protected from environmental assaults and bolstered by healthy-living strategies such as these:

Don't smoke or vape.
Eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Take a multivitamin if you suspect that you may not be getting all the nutrients you need through your diet.
Exercise regularly.
Maintain a healthy weight.
Control your stress level.
Control your blood pressure.
If you drink alcohol, drink only in moderation (no more than one to two drinks a day for men, no more than one a day for women).
Get enough sleep.
Take steps to avoid infection, such as washing your hands frequently and trying not to touch your hands to your face, since harmful germs can enter through your eyes, nose, and mouth. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus"
should i go to the doctor or dentist for nonurgent appointments,"During this period of social distancing, it is best to postpone nonurgent appointments with your doctor or dentist. These may include regular well visits or dental cleanings, as well as follow-up appointments to manage chronic conditions if your health has been relatively stable in the recent past. You should also postpone routine screening tests, such as a mammogram or PSA blood test, if you are at average risk of disease. Many doctor's offices have started restricting office visits to urgent matters only, so you may not have a choice in the matter.

As an alternative, doctor's offices are increasingly providing telehealth services. This may mean appointments by phone call, or virtual visits using a video chat service. Ask to schedule a telehealth appointment with your doctor for a new or ongoing nonurgent matter. If, after speaking to you, your doctor would like to see you in person, he or she will let you know.

What if your appointments are not urgent but also don't fall into the low-risk category? For example, if you have been advised to have periodic scans after cancer remission, if your doctor sees you regularly to monitor for a condition for which you're at increased risk, or if your treatment varies based on your most recent test results? In these and similar cases, call your doctor for advice. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/preventing-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus"
should i postpone my elective surgery,"It's likely that your elective surgery or procedure will be canceled or rescheduled by the hospital or medical center in which you are scheduled to have the procedure. If not, then during this period of social distancing, you should consider postponing any procedure that can wait.

That being said, keep in mind that ""elective"" is a relative term. For instance, you may not have needed immediate surgery for sciatica caused by a herniated disc. But the pain may be so severe that you would not be able to endure postponing the surgery for weeks or perhaps months. In that case, you and your doctor should make a shared decision about proceeding.

who is at highest risk for getting very sick from covid,"Older people, especially those with underlying medical problems like chronic bronchitis, emphysema, heart failure, or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.

In addition, several underlying medical conditions may increase the risk of serious COVID-19 for individuals of any age. These include:

blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease, or taking blood thinners
chronic kidney disease
chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis
any condition or treatment that weakens the immune response (cancer, cancer treatment, organ or bone marrow transplant, immunosuppressant medications, HIV or AIDS)
current or recent pregnancy in the last two weeks
diabetes
inherited metabolic disorders and mitochondrial disorders
heart disease, including coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, and heart failure
lung disease, including asthma, COPD (chronic bronchitis or emphysema)
neurological and neurologic and neurodevelopment conditions such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy (seizure disorders), stroke, intellectual disability, moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injury. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-you-are-at-higher-risk"
i m older and have a chronic medical condition which puts me at higher risk for getting seriously ill or even dying from covid what can i do to reduce my risk of exposure to the virus,"Anyone 60 years or older is considered to be at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19. This is true whether or not you also have an underlying medical condition, although the sickest individuals and most of the deaths have been among people who were both older and had chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease, lung problems or diabetes.

The CDC suggests the following measures for those who are at higher risk:

Obtain several weeks of medications and supplies in case you need to stay home for prolonged periods of time.
Take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others.
When you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick, limit close contact, and wash your hands often.
Avoid crowds.
Avoid cruise travel and nonessential air travel.
During a COVID-19 outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible to further reduce your risk of being exposed. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-you-are-at-higher-risk"
i have a chronic medical condition that puts me at increased risk for severe illness from covid even though i m only in my s what can i do to reduce my risk,"You can take steps to lower your risk of getting infected in the first place:

As much as possible, limit contact with people outside your family.
Maintain enough distance (six feet or more) between yourself and anyone outside your family.
Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for 20 to 30 seconds.
As best you can, avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.
Stay away from people who are sick.
During a COVID-19 outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible to further reduce your risk of being exposed.
Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces in your home, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables, every day.
In addition, do your best to keep your condition well-controlled. That means following your doctor's recommendations including taking medications as directed. If possible, get a 90-day supply of your prescription medications and request that they be mailed to you so you don't have to go to the pharmacy to pick them up. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-you-are-at-higher-risk"
i have asthma if i get covid am i more likely to become seriously ill,"Yes, asthma may increase your risk of getting very sick from COVID-19.

However, you can take steps to lower your risk of getting infected in the first place. These include

social distancing
washing your hands often with soap and warm water for 20 to 30 seconds
not touching your eyes, nose or mouth
staying away from people who are sick.
In addition, you should continue to take your asthma medicines as prescribed to keep your asthma under control. If you do get sick, follow your asthma action plan and call your doctor. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-you-are-at-higher-risk"
i m taking a medication that suppresses my immune system should i stop taking it so i have less chance of getting sick from the coronavirus,"If you contract the virus, your response to it will depend on many factors, only one of which is taking medication that suppresses your immune system. In addition, stopping the medication on your own could cause your underlying condition to get worse. Most importantly, don't make this decision on your own. It's always best not to adjust the dose or stop taking a prescription medication without first talking to the doctor who prescribed the medication. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-you-are-at-higher-risk"
i heard that certain blood pressure medicines might worsen symptoms of covid should i stop taking my medication now just in case i do get infected should i stop if i develop symptoms of covid,"You are referring to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), two types of medications used primarily to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and heart disease. Doctors also prescribe these medicines for people who have protein in their urine, a common problem in people with diabetes.

At this time, the American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of Cardiology (ACC), and the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) strongly recommend that people taking these medications should continue to do so, even if they become infected.

Here's how this concern got started. Researchers doing animal studies on a different coronavirus (the SARS coronavirus from the early 2000s) found that certain sites on lung cells called ACE-2 receptors appeared to help the SARS virus enter the lungs and cause pneumonia. ACE inhibitor and ARB drugs raised ACE-2 receptor levels in the animals.

Could this mean people taking these drugs are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection and are more likely to get pneumonia?

The reality today:

Human studies have not confirmed the findings in animal studies.
Some studies suggest that ACE inhibitors and ARBs may reduce lung injury in people with other viral pneumonias. The same might be true of pneumonia caused by the COVID-19 virus.
Stopping your ACE inhibitor or ARB could actually put you at greater risk of complications from the infection, since it's likely that your blood pressure will rise and heart problems would get worse.
The bottom line: The AHA, ACC, and HFSA strongly recommend continuing to take ACE inhibitor or ARB medications, even if you get sick with COVID-19. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-you-are-at-higher-risk"
what should i do if i think i or my child may have a covid infection,"First call your doctor or pediatrician for advice.

If you do not have a doctor and you are concerned that you or your child may have COVID-19, contact your local board of health. They can direct you to the best place for evaluation and treatment in your area.

It's best to not seek medical care in an emergency department unless you have symptoms of severe illness. Severe symptoms include high or very low body temperature, shortness of breath, confusion, or feeling you might pass out. Call the emergency department ahead of time to let the staff know that you are coming, so they can be prepared for your arrival. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus"
how do i know if i have covid or the regular flu,"COVID-19 often causes symptoms similar to those a person with a bad cold or the flu would experience. And like the flu, the symptoms can progress and become life-threatening. Your doctor is more likely to suspect coronavirus if:

you have respiratory symptoms
and
you have been exposed to someone suspected of having COVID-19, or
there has been community spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 in your area. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus"
how is someone tested for covid,"A specialized test must be done to confirm that a person has been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Most often a clinician takes a swab of your nose (or both your nose and throat). New methods of testing that can be done on site will become more available over the next few weeks. These new tests can provide results in as little as 15–45 minutes. Meanwhile, most tests will still be delivered to labs that have been approved to perform the test.

Some people are starting to have a blood test to look for antibodies to the COVID-19 virus. Because the blood test for antibodies doesn't become positive until after an infected person improves, it is not useful as a diagnostic test at this time. Scientists are using this blood antibody test to identify potential plasma donors. The antibodies can be purified from the plasma and may help some very sick people get better. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus"
what are the differences between the nasal swab and saliva tests for covid,"Until recently, most tests for COVID-19 required a clinician to insert a long swab into the nose and sometimes down to the throat. In mid-April, the FDA granted emergency approval for a saliva-based test.

The saliva test is easier to perform — spitting into a cup versus submitting to a swab — and more comfortable. Because a person can independently spit into a cup, the saliva test does not require interaction with a healthcare worker. This cuts down on the need for masks, gowns, gloves, and other protective equipment, which has been in short supply.

Both the saliva and swab tests work by detecting genetic material from the coronavirus. Both tests are very specific, meaning that a positive test almost always means that the person is infected with the virus. However, both tests can be negative, even if a person is proven later to be infected (known as a false negative). This is especially true for people who carry the virus but have no symptoms.

Some early reports suggest that the saliva test may have fewer false negatives than the swab test. If verified, home testing could potentially quickly ramp up the widespread testing we desperately need. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus"
how reliable is the test for covid,"In the US, the most common test for the COVID-19 virus looks for viral RNA in a sample taken with a swab from a person's nose or throat. Tests results may come back in as little as 15–45 minutes for some of the newer on-site tests; with other tests you may wait three to four days for results.

If a test result comes back positive, it is almost certain that the person is infected.

A negative test result is less definite. An infected person could get a so-called ""false negative"" test result if the swab missed the virus, for example, or because of an inadequacy of the test itself. We also don't yet know at what point during the course of illness a test becomes positive.

If you experience COVID-like symptoms and get a negative test result, there is no reason to repeat the test unless your symptoms get worse. If your symptoms do worsen, call your doctor or local or state healthcare department for guidance on further testing. You should also self-isolate at home. Wear a mask if you have one when interacting with members of your household. And practice social distancing. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus"
what is serologic antibody testing for covid what can it be used for,"A serologic test is a blood test that looks for antibodies created by your immune system. There are many reasons you might make antibodies, the most important of which is to help fight infections. The serologic test for COVID-19 specifically looks for antibodies against the COVID-19 virus.

Your body takes at least five to 10 days after you have acquired the infection to develop antibodies to this virus. For this reason, serologic tests are not sensitive enough to accurately diagnose an active COVID-19 infection, even in people with symptoms.

However, serologic tests can help identify anyone who has recovered from coronavirus. This may include people who were not initially identified as having COVID-19 because they had no symptoms, had mild symptoms, chose not to get tested, had a false-negative test, or could not get tested for any reason. Serologic tests will provide a more accurate picture of how many people have been infected with, and recovered from, coronavirus, as well as the true fatality rate.

Serologic tests may also provide information about whether people become immune to coronavirus once they've recovered and, if so, how long that immunity lasts. In time, these tests may be used to determine who can safely go back out into the community.

Scientists can also study coronavirus antibodies to learn which parts of the coronavirus the immune system responds to, in turn giving them clues about which part of the virus to target in vaccines they are developing.

Serological tests are starting to become available and are being developed by many private companies worldwide. However, the accuracy of these tests needs to be validated before widespread use in the US. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus"
how soon after i m infected with the new coronavirus will i start to be contagious,"The time from exposure to symptom onset (known as the incubation period) is thought to be three to 14 days, though symptoms typically appear within four or five days after exposure.

We know that a person with COVID-19 may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before starting to experience symptoms. Emerging research suggests that people may actually be most likely to spread the virus to others during the 48 hours before they start to experience symptoms.

If true, this strengthens the case for face masks, physical distancing, and contact tracing, all of which can help reduce the risk that someone who is infected but not yet contagious may unknowingly infect others. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus"
for how long after i am infected will i continue to be contagious at what point in my illness will i be most contagious,"People are thought to be most contagious early in the course of their illness, when they are beginning to experience symptoms, especially if they are coughing and sneezing. But people with no symptoms can also spread the coronavirus to other people if they stand too close to them. In fact, people who are infected may be more likely to spread the illness if they are asymptomatic, or in the days before they develop symptoms, because they are less likely to be isolating or adopting behaviors designed to prevent spread.

Most people with coronavirus who have symptoms will no longer be contagious by 10 days after symptoms resolve. People who test positive for the virus but never develop symptoms over the following 10 days after testing are probably no longer contagious, but again there are documented exceptions. So some experts are still recommending 14 days of isolation.

One of the main problems with general rules regarding contagion and transmission of this coronavirus is the marked differences in how it behaves in different individuals. That's why everyone needs to wear a mask and keep a physical distance of at least six feet.

Here is a more ""scientific"" way to determine if you are no longer contagious: have two nasal-throat tests or saliva tests 24 hours apart that are both negative for the virus. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus"
if i get sick with covid how long until i will feel better,"It depends on how sick you get. Those with mild cases appear to recover within one to two weeks. With severe cases, recovery can take six weeks or more. According to the most recent estimates, about 1% of infected persons will succumb to the disease. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus"
how long after i start to feel better will be it be safe for me to go back out in public again,"We don't know for certain. Based on the most recent research, people may continue to be infected with the virus and be potentially contagious for many days after they are feeling better. But these results need to be verified. Until then, even after 10 days of complete resolution of your symptoms, you should still take all precautions if you do need to go out in public, including wearing a mask, minimizing touching surfaces, and keeping at least six feet of distance away from other people. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus"
what s the difference between self isolation and self quarantine and who should consider them,"Self-isolation is voluntary isolation at home by those who have or are likely to have COVID-19 and are experiencing mild symptoms of the disease (in contrast to those who are severely ill and may be isolated in a hospital). The purpose of self-isolation is to prevent spread of infection from an infected person to others who are not infected. If possible, the decision to isolate should be based on physician recommendation. If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you should self-isolate.

You should strongly consider self-isolation if you

have been tested for COVID-19 and are awaiting test results
have been exposed to the new coronavirus and are experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (fever, cough, difficulty breathing), whether or not you have been tested.
You may also consider self-isolation if you have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (fever, cough, difficulty breathing) but have not had known exposure to the new coronavirus and have not been tested for the virus that causes COVID-19. In this case, it may be reasonable to isolate yourself until your symptoms fully resolve, or until you are able to be tested for COVID-19 and your test comes back negative.

Self-quarantine for 14 days by anyone with a household member who has been infected, whether or not they themselves are infected, is the current recommendation of the White House task force. Otherwise, voluntary quarantine at home by those who may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus but are not experiencing symptoms associated with COVID-19 (fever, cough, difficulty breathing). The purpose of self-quarantine (as with self-isolation) is to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19. When possible, the decision to quarantine should be based on physician recommendation. Self-quarantine is reasonable if you are not experiencing symptoms, but have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus"
what does it really mean to self isolate or self quarantine what should or shouldn t i do,"If you are sick with COVID-19 or think you may be infected with the COVID-19 virus, it is important not to spread the infection to others while you recover. While home-isolation or home-quarantine may sound like a staycation, you should be prepared for a long period during which you might feel disconnected from others and anxious about your health and the health of your loved ones. Staying in touch with others by phone or online can be helpful to maintain social connections, ask for help, and update others on your condition.

Here's what the CDC recommends to minimize the risk of spreading the infection to others in your home and community.

Stay home except to get medical care

Do not go to work, school, or public areas.
Avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.
Call ahead before visiting your doctor

Call your doctor and tell them that you have or may have COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider's office to take steps to keep other people from getting infected or exposed.
Separate yourself from other people and animals in your home

As much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from other people in your home. Use a separate bathroom, if available.
Restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would around other people. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a face mask.
Wear a face mask if you are sick

Wear a face mask when you are around other people or pets and before you enter a doctor's office or hospital.
Cover your coughs and sneezes

Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and throw used tissues in a lined trash can.
Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after you sneeze. If soap and water are not available, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Clean your hands often

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Don't share personal household items

Do not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people or pets in your home.
After using these items, they should be washed thoroughly with soap and water.
Clean all ""high-touch"" surfaces every day

High touch surfaces include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables.

Clean and disinfect areas that may have any bodily fluids on them.
A list of products suitable for use against COVID-19 is available here. This list has been pre-approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Monitor your symptoms

Monitor yourself for fever by taking your temperature twice a day and remain alert for cough or difficulty breathing.
If you have not had symptoms and you begin to feel feverish or develop measured fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, immediately limit contact with others if you have not already done so. Call your doctor or local health department to determine whether you need a medical evaluation.
Seek prompt medical attention if your illness is worsening, for example if you have difficulty breathing. Before going to a doctor's office or hospital, call your doctor and tell them that you have, or are being evaluated for, COVID-19.
Put on a face mask before you enter a healthcare facility or any time you may come into contact with others.
If you have a medical emergency and need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that you have or are being evaluated for COVID-19. If possible, put on a face mask before emergency medical services arrive. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus"
what types of medications and health supplies should i have on hand for an extended stay at home,"Try to stock at least a 30-day supply of any needed prescriptions. If your insurance permits 90-day refills, that's even better. Make sure you also have over-the-counter medications and other health supplies on hand.

Medical and health supplies

prescription medications
prescribed medical supplies such as glucose and blood-pressure monitoring equipment
fever and pain medicine, such as acetaminophen
cough and cold medicines
antidiarrheal medication
thermometer
fluids with electrolytes
soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizer
tissues, toilet paper, disposable diapers, tampons, sanitary napkins
garbage bags. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus"
should i keep extra food at home what kind,"Consider keeping a two-week to 30-day supply of nonperishable food at home. These items can also come in handy in other types of emergencies, such as power outages or snowstorms.

canned meats, fruits, vegetables, and soups
frozen fruits, vegetables, and meat
protein or fruit bars
dry cereal, oatmeal, or granola
peanut butter or nuts
pasta, bread, rice, and other grains
canned beans
chicken broth, canned tomatoes, jarred pasta sauce
oil for cooking
flour, sugar
crackers
coffee, tea, shelf-stable milk, canned juices
bottled water
canned or jarred baby food and formula
pet food
household supplies like laundry detergent, dish soap, and household cleaner. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus"
when can i discontinue my self quarantine,"While many experts are recommending 14 days of self-quarantine for those who are concerned that they may be infected, the decision to discontinue these measures should be made on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with your doctor and state and local health departments. The decision will be based on the risk of infecting others. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus"
how can i protect myself while caring for someone that may have covid,"You should take many of the same precautions as you would if you were caring for someone with the flu:

Stay in another room or be separated from the person as much as possible. Use a separate bedroom and bathroom, if available.
Make sure that shared spaces in the home have good air flow. Turn on an air conditioner or open a window.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry. Use soap and water if your hands are visibly dirty.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Extra precautions:
You and the person should wear a face mask if you are in the same room.
Wear a disposable face mask and gloves when you touch or have contact with the person's blood, stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, vomit, urine.
Throw out disposable face masks and gloves after using them. Do not reuse.
First remove and throw away gloves. Then, immediately clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Next, remove and throw away the face mask, and immediately clean your hands again with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Do not share household items such as dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding, or other items with the person who is sick. After the person uses these items, wash them thoroughly.
Clean all ""high-touch"" surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables, every day. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them. Use a household cleaning spray or wipe.
Wash laundry thoroughly.
Immediately remove and wash clothes or bedding that have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.
Wear disposable gloves while handling soiled items and keep soiled items away from your body. Clean your hands immediately after removing your gloves.
Place all used disposable gloves, face masks, and other contaminated items in a lined container before disposing of them with other household waste. Clean your hands (with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer) immediately after handling these items. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus"
my parents are older which puts them at higher risk for covid and they don t live nearby how can i help them if they get sick,"Caring from a distance can be stressful. Start by talking to your parents about what they would need if they were to get sick. Put together a single list of emergency contacts for their (and your) reference, including doctors, family members, neighbors, and friends. Include contact information for their local public health department.

You can also help them to plan ahead. For example, ask your parents to give their neighbors or friends a set of house keys. Have them stock up on prescription and over-the counter medications, health and emergency medical supplies, and nonperishable food and household supplies. Check in regularly by phone, Skype, or however you like to stay in touch. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus"
can i infect my pet,"There have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19, but the CDC still recommends that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a face mask. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus"
are kids immune to the virus that causes covid,"Children, including very young children, can develop COVID-19. However, children tend to experience milder symptoms such as low-grade fever, fatigue, and cough. Some children have had severe complications, but this has been less common. Children with underlying health conditions may be at increased risk for severe illness. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/coronavirus-outbreak-and-kids"
should parents take babies for initial vaccines right now what about toddlers and up who are due for vaccines,"The answer depends on many factors, including what your doctor's office is offering. As with all health care decisions, it comes down to weighing risks and benefits.

Getting early immunizations in for babies and toddlers — especially babies 6 months and younger — has important benefits. It helps to protect them from infections such as pneumococcus and pertussis that can be deadly, at a time when their immune system is vulnerable. At the same time, they could be vulnerable to complications of COVID-19 should their trip to the doctor expose them to the virus.

For children older than 2 years, waiting is probably fine — in most cases. For some children with special conditions, or those who are behind on immunizations, waiting may not be a good idea.

The best thing to do is call your doctor's office. Find out what precautions they are taking to keep children safe, and discuss your particular situation, including not only your child's health situation, but also the prevalence of the virus in your community and whether you have been or might have been exposed. Together, you can make the best decision for your child. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/coronavirus-outbreak-and-kids"
when do you need to bring your child to the doctor during this pandemic,"Anything that isn't urgent should be postponed until a safer time. This would include checkups for healthy children over 2 years (many practices are postponing checkups even for younger children if they are generally healthy). It would also include follow up appointments for anything that can wait, like a follow-up for ADHD in a child that is doing well socially and academically. Your doctor's office can give you guidance about what can wait — and when to reschedule. Many practices are offering phone or telemedicine visits, and it's remarkable how many things can be addressed that way.

Some things, though, do require an in-person appointment, including:

Illness or injury that could be serious, such as a child with trouble breathing, significant pain, unusual sleepiness, a high fever that won't come down, or a cut that may need stitches or a bone that may be broken. Call your doctor for guidance as to whether you should bring your child to the office or a local emergency room.
Children who are receiving ongoing treatments for a serious medical condition such as cancer, kidney disease, or a rheumatologic disease. These might include chemotherapy, infusions of other medications, dialysis, or transfusions. Your doctor will advise you about any changes in treatments or how they are to be given during the pandemic. Do not skip any appointments unless your doctor tells you to do so.
Checkups for very young children who need vaccines and to have their growth checked. Check with your doctor regarding their current policies and practices.
Checkups and visits for children with certain health conditions. This might include children with breathing problems whose lungs need to be listened to, children who need vaccinations to protect their immune system, children whose blood pressure is too high, children who aren't gaining weight, children who need stitches out or a cast off, or children with abnormal blood tests that need rechecking. If your child is being followed for a medical problem, call your doctor for advice. Together you can figure out when and how your child should be seen.
Bottom line: Talk to your doctor. The decision will depend on a combination of factors including your child's condition, how prevalent the virus is in your community, whether you have had any exposures or possible exposures, what safeguards your doctor has put into place, and how you would get to the doctor.

with schools closing in many parts of the country is it okay to have babysitters or child care people in the house given no know exposures or illness in their homes,"The truth is that the fewer people you and your children are exposed to, the better. However, the reality is that not every family will be able to have a parent at home at all times.

All people can do is try to minimize the risk by doing things like:

choosing a babysitter who has minimal exposures to other people besides your family
limiting the number of babysitters. If you can keep it to one, that's ideal, but if not keep the number as low as possible
making sure that the babysitter understands that he or she needs to practice social distancing, and needs to let you know (and not come to your house!) if he or she feels at all sick or has a known exposure to COVID-19
having the babysitter limit physical interactions and closeness with your children, to the extent that this is possible
making sure that everyone washes their hands frequently throughout the day, especially before eating. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/coronavirus-outbreak-and-kids"
with social distancing rules in place libraries recreational sports and bigger sports events and other venues parents often take kids to are closing down are there any rules of thumb regarding play dates i don t want my kids parked in front of screens all day,"Ideally, to make social distancing truly effective, there shouldn't be play dates. If you can be reasonably sure that the friend is healthy and has had no contact with anyone who might be sick, then playing with a single friend might be okay, but we can't really be sure if anyone has had contact.

Outdoor play dates, where you can create more physical distance, might be a compromise. Something like going for a bike ride, or a hike, allows you to be together while sharing fewer germs (bringing and using hand sanitizer is still a good idea). You need to have ground rules, though, about distance and touching, and if you don't think it's realistic that your children will follow those rules, then don't do the play date even if it is outdoors.

You can still go for family hikes or bike rides where you're around to enforce social distancing rules. Family soccer games, cornhole, or badminton in the backyard are also fun ways to get outside.

You can also do virtual play dates, using a platform like FaceTime or Skype so children can interact and play without being in the same room. For more information, please visit https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/coronavirus-outbreak-and-kids"
i live with my children and grandchildren what can i do to reduce the risk of getting sick when caring for my grandchildren,"In a situation where there is no choice — such as if the grandparent lives with the grandchildren — then the family should do everything they can to try to limit the risk of COVID-19. The grandchildren should be isolated as much as possible, as should the parents, so that the overall family risk is as low as possible. Everyone should wash their hands very frequently throughout the day, and surfaces should be wiped clean frequently. Physical contact should be limited to the absolutely necessary; as wonderful as it can be to snuggle with Grandma or Grandpa, now is not the time.

if i have the covid virus what can i do to keep from infecting others,"The CDC recommends that people who are actively sick with COVID-19 stay away from others as much as possible. That means separating yourself from others in your home and using a separate bathroom, if possible.

You should restrict activities outside your home, except for getting medical care. Do not go to work, school or public areas. Avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing or taxis. If you must be around other people, even at home, you should wear a covering over your nose and mouth.

You should remain isolated until there is no longer a chance you can infect others. The length of time you may be considered actively sick can vary by case, so a decision about leaving isolation should be made in consultation with your doctor. For more information, please visit https://stanfordhealthcare.org/stanford-health-care-now/2020/novel-coronavirus/faqs-about-covid-19.html"
how can i protect myself from getting covid,"The CDC recommends these general practices to help prevent spreading viruses:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipes.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash your hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. For more information, please visit https://stanfordhealthcare.org/stanford-health-care-now/2020/novel-coronavirus/faqs-about-covid-19.html"
should i wear a mask,"Wearing a mask can help prevent those who are infected from spreading the virus and offers some protection to the person wearing it. Some public health experts recommend all people wear masks when in public. The CDC recommends the wearing of cloth face coverings to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as grocery stores and pharmacies. For more information, please visit https://stanfordhealthcare.org/stanford-health-care-now/2020/novel-coronavirus/faqs-about-covid-19.html"

if i m sick and i m not sure if i have covid should i go see a doctor,"People who are mildly ill and think they might have COVID-19 can isolate themselves from others at home during their illness. If you feel sick with fever, cough or have difficulty breathing, contact a primary care provider, who will assess your symptoms and exposure to determine if a COVID-19 test is appropriate. For more information, please visit https://stanfordhealthcare.org/stanford-health-care-now/2020/novel-coronavirus/faqs-about-covid-19.html"
can someone who has been quarantined for covid spread the illness to others,"Being quarantined means being separated from people who have been exposed to COVID-19 but who have not had symptoms for the length of the incubation period of the disease. For COVID-19 that period is 14 days from the last date of exposure. Someone who has been released from quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading, according to the CDC. For more information, please visit https://stanfordhealthcare.org/stanford-health-care-now/2020/novel-coronavirus/faqs-about-covid-19.html"
is there a vaccine or treatment for covid,"Not yet. Currently there is no vaccine or specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-19. However, there are vaccines and drugs currently under investigation. The National Institutes of Health has estimated that a large clinical trial for a vaccine may be available in 12-15 months.

People with COVID-19 should receive care to relieve symptoms. Those with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover through supportive care. For more information, please visit https://stanfordhealthcare.org/stanford-health-care-now/2020/novel-coronavirus/faqs-about-covid-19.html"

what is covid,"COVID-19 refers to the human infection caused by the new coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2. While symptoms of many human coronavirus infections are mild, COVID-19 infection symptoms can be serious, leading to pneumonia and in some cases death. COVID-19 is caused by a new virus strain that is believed to have originated around the city of Wuhan, China, and began spreading among people in late 2019. For more information, please visit https://stanfordhealthcare.org/stanford-health-care-now/2020/novel-coronavirus/faqs-about-covid-19.html"
what is the source of the virus now affecting people,"It is rare for an animal coronavirus to spread from animals to people, and from people to each other. However, this was the case with both SARS and MERS, and scientists suspect this is what is happening with COVID-19. For more information, please visit https://stanfordhealthcare.org/stanford-health-care-now/2020/novel-coronavirus/faqs-about-covid-19.html"
how does the virus spread,"Officials are still learning about how COVID-19 spreads, but the CDC believes it spreads between people in three ways:

From close contact with people who have it.
From respiratory droplets that become airborne when someone, who is infected, sneezes or coughs nearby.
From touching our mouths, noses or eyes after touching a surface that has the virus on it. For more information, please visit https://stanfordhealthcare.org/stanford-health-care-now/2020/novel-coronavirus/faqs-about-covid-19.html"
will warm weather stop the outbreak of covid,"Researchers are still learning about how easily COVID-19 is transmitted, how severely it will impact communities, and whether seasonal weather changes impact its spread. Some viruses, such as the common cold and flu, spread more during cold months, but it’s unclear whether COVID-19 will behave in the same way. For more information, please visit https://stanfordhealthcare.org/stanford-health-care-now/2020/novel-coronavirus/faqs-about-covid-19.html"
